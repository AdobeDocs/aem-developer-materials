   :layout:

   The tabs layout.

   It has the following content structure at the layout resource:

   .. gnd:gnd::

      [granite:LayoutsTabs]

      /**
       * The layout mode of the tabs.
       *
       * default
       *    If the property is not specified, it is in default mode, where tab area is above the panel area.
       *    This is designed to divide pieces of content within a page.
       * stacked
       *    The tab area is side-by-side with the panel area.
       *    This is designed to divide pieces of content within a page.
       * large
       *    Similar to default mode, but larger. This is designed to divide pages.
       */
      - type (String) < 'stacked', 'large'

      /**
       * ``true`` to add padding to each panel; ``false`` otherwise.
       */
      - padding (Boolean) = 'true'

   Each tab can be any component, and specified using :ref:`ItemDataSource <ItemDataSource>`. It also needs at very least satisfies the following content structure:

   .. gnd:gnd::

      [granite:LayoutsTabsTab]

      /**
       * The tab title.
       */
      - jcr:title (String) mandatory i18n

      /**
       * The item specific config for the layout.
       */
      + layoutConfig (granite:LayoutsTabsTabLayoutconfig)


      [granite:LayoutsTabsTabLayoutconfig]

      /**
       * Indicates if the tab is active. If no single tab's ``active`` property is specifically set to ``true``, then the first tab is active.
       */
      - active (Boolean)

      /**
       * Indicates the icon of the tab.
       */
      - icon (String)

      /**
       * ``true`` to add padding for the panel. This property only makes sense when ``padding`` property at the layout node is set to ``false``.
       */
      - padding (Boolean)

   Example::

      + mytabs
        - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/container"
        + layout
          - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/layouts/tabs"
        + items
          + tab1
            - jcr:title = "Tab 1"
            - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/container"
          + tab2
            - jcr:title = "Tab 2"
            - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/container"
            + layoutConfig
              - active = true
