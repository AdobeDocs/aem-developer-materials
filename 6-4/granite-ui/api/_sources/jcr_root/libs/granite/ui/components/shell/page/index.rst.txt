.. granite:servercomponent:: /libs/granite/ui/components/shell/page

   The generic page to render Shell.

   It also supports :doc:`resource filtering using FilteringResourceWrapper </jcr_root/libs/granite/ui/docs/server/resourcehiding>` and acts as its container.

   It has the following content structure:
