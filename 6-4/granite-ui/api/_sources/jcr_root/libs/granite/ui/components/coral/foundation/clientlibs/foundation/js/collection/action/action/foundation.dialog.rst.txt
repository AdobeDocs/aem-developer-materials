foundation.collection.action.action: foundation.dialog
======================================================

``foundation.dialog`` is an :ref:`action of foundation-collection-action <foundation-collection-action-action>`.

When the action is triggered, it will load and show the dialog.
It supports the following parameters:

config.data.src
   The URI Template to load the dialog.

   It is expanded using variables satisfying the following interface:

   .. code-block:: ts

      interface FoundationCollectionActionFoundationDialogVariables {
        /**
         * The value of <code>data-foundation-collection-id</code> attribute of the given <code>collection</code> parameter.
         */
        id: string;

        /**
         * The array of values of <code>data-foundation-collection-item-id</code> attribute of the given <code>selections</code> parameter.
         */
        item: string[];
      }

config.data.target
   The selector to the ``.foundation-toggleable`` that will be shown upon activate.

config.data.nesting
   Indicates the behavior when the action is also under another toggleable element.

   It has the following value:

   hide
      Hide the parent toggleable element.

      For example if the action is under Popover A. When the value is ``hide``, upon activating the action, Popover A will also be closed.


Dialog Requirement
------------------

A dialog can be any element as long as it is implementing :doc:`../../../../vocabulary/toggleable`.

The target dialog is loaded based on the following priority:

1. The dialog loaded by ``src`` parameter, if the parameter is specified.
2. The dialog located at ``target`` parameter, if the parameter is specified.
3. The containing ``.foundation-toggleable``. (i.e. equivalent to jQuery: ``action.closest(".foundation-toggleable")``)
