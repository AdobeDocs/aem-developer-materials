Common Attributes
=================

UI components often share certain intentions. This topic is describing the current intentions available, such that the benefit of standardization can be leveraged. When developing a new server component, it is RECOMMENDED to use these shared intentions, instead of creating your own names. Any common intention arises in the future will be also added here.

This concept is analogous to `HTML global attributes <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes>`_.

Currently the following properties and nodes are common:

.. gnd:gnd::

   [granite:commonAttrs]

   /**
    * The HTML id attribute.
    */
   - granite:id (String)

   /**
    * The HTML class attribute. This is used to indicate the semantic relationship of the component similar to HTML ``rel`` attribute.
    */
   - granite:rel (String)

   /**
    * The HTML class attribute.
    */
   - granite:class (String)

   /**
    * The HTML title attribute.
    */
   - granite:title (String) i18n

   /**
    * The HTML hidden attribute.
    */
   - granite:hidden (Boolean)

   /**
    * The HTML itemscope attribute.
    */
   - granite:itemscope (Boolean)

   /**
    * The HTML itemtype attribute.
    */
   - granite:itemtype (String)

   /**
    * The HTML itemprop attribute.
    */
   - granite:itemprop (String)

   /**
    * Each property of this node is converted into a `HTML data-* attribute <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*>`_.
    * If the property value is an instance of a String, it will be interpreted as :doc:`StringEL <el>`.
    * The property with a prefixed name is ignored.
    */
   + granite:data


Component Development
---------------------

To leverage these common attributes in your component, you can use :javadoc:`ComponentHelper#populateCommonAttrs(AttrBuilder) <com/adobe/granite/ui/components/ComponentHelper.html#populateCommonAttrs(com.adobe.granite.ui.components.AttrBuilder)>`:

.. code-block:: java

   Tag tag = cmp.consumeTag();
   AttrBuilder attrs = tag.getAttrs();
   cmp.populateCommonAttrs(attrs);
