betty-SimpleBar
***************

``.betty-SimpleBar`` is a CSS component to satisfy the requirement of Betty ActionBar.

The difference between this component and :doc:`actionbar` is that this component doesn't have the reflowing behaviour.
Because of this, only a simpler scenario where there is a main item (that is maximized) and a few buttons makes sense.
