.foundation-toggleable-control
==============================

Indicates the control.
The ``.foundation-toggleable`` element managed by this control is determined by the following priorities:

1. the element specified at [data-foundation-toggleable-control-target].
2. the closest ancestor (i.e. equivalent using jQuery: ``control.closest(".foundation-toggleable")``)

Selector Rule::

   .foundation-toggleable-control


[data-foundation-toggleable-control-action]
===========================================

Indicates the action to take.
The valid values are ``show`` and ``hide``, that will call ``FoundationToggleable.show()`` or ``FoundationToggleable.hide()`` respectively.
If this attribute is not specified, then it is interpreted as a toggle. i.e. Show the target element when it is hidden, and hide it when it is already shown.

   .foundation-toggleable-control[data-foundation-toggleable-control-action]
