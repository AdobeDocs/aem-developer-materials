=============

.. granite:servercomponent:: /libs/granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/wizard/lazycontainer

   A step component that will load its content when the wizard is navigating to it.
   Use this component when you need a step that is depending on the user input in the preceding steps.

   It has the following content structure:

   .. gnd:gnd::

      [granite:WizardLazyContainer] > granite:commonAttrs, granite:renderCondition

      /**
       * The URI Template to fetch the content of the panel.
       * The variables passed to the template are the fields (e.g. textfield, select) of the preceding steps.
       * The field's name and value are used as variable name and value respectively.
       */
      - src (StringEL)

      /**
       * Put vertical margin to the root element.
       */
      - margin (Boolean)

      /**
       * Make the element maximized to fill the available space.
       */
      - maximized (Boolean)

            + items
              + field1
                - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/form/textfield"
                - name = "field1"
            + parentConfig
              + prev
                - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/anchorbutton"
                - granite:class = "foundation-wizard-control"
                - text = "Cancel"
                + granite:data
                  - foundation-wizard-control-action = "cancel"
