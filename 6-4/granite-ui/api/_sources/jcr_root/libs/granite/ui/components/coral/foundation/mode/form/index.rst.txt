.. granite:servercomponent:: /libs/granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/mode/form
   :deprecated:

   .. warning:: The read-only mode of the field is deprecated, hence this component is also deprecated.

   Form is a container that leverages :doc:`/jcr_root/libs/granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/clientlibs/foundation/vocabulary/mode` vocabulary
   to switch between ``default`` and ``edit`` mode.
   When it is in the ``default`` mode, the form fields show the readonly rendering, while showing the editing rendering in ``edit`` mode.

   When ``foundation-mode-change`` event is triggered, this component will change itself to that mode.

   It has the following content structure:

   .. gnd:gnd::

      [granite:ModeForm] > granite:commonAttrs, granite:renderCondition, granite:container

      /**
       * The mode of the form.
       *
       * default
       *    The form is shown in readonly mode, where the fields are optimized for reading, instead of editing.
       * edit
       *    The form is shown in edit mode, where the fields are ready to handle user inputs.
       */
      - mode (StringEL) < 'default', 'edit'

      /**
       * The mode group that this component will be part of.
       */
      - group (String)

      /**
       * Put vertical margin to the root element.
       */
      - margin (Boolean)

      /**
       * Make the element maximized to fill the available space.
       */
      - maximized (Boolean)
