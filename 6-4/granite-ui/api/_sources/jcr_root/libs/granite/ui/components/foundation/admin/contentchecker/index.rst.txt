ContentChecker
==============

.. granite:servercomponent:: /libs/granite/ui/components/foundation/admin/contentchecker

   ContentChecker is a component to check if a content is allowed to be managed by the admin.
   If the content is not allowed, the request is redirected to a different location instead.

   It has the following content structure:

   .. gnd:gnd::

      [granite:AdminContentChecker]

      /**
       * The path of the resource to check.
       */
      - path (String)

      /**
       * The complete path of the content to check (can contain selectors and extensions).
       * This property is only considered if <code>path</code> property is not set.
       */
      - urlPath (String)

      /**
       * ``true`` to allow if the path is ``null``; ``false`` otherwise.
       */
      - allowEmpty (Boolean) = true

      /**
       * The regex to match the path; when not specified, the content is allowed.
       */
      - allowed (String) multiple

      /**
       * The URL to redirect to.
       */
      - redirect (StringEL) = '/'

   Example::

      + node1
        - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
        - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/admin/contentchecker"
        - path = "${requestPathInfo.suffix}"
        - allowEmpty = false
        - allowed = ["/content(?!.*?\b(catalogs|campaigns|dam|launches|mac|publications|usergenerated)\b).*"]
        - redirect = "/sites.html/content"
