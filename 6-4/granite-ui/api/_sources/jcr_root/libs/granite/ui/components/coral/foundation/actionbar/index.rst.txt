      /**
       * Put vertical margin to the root element.
       */
      - margin (Boolean)

      /**
       * The size of the ActionBar.
       */
      - size (String) = 'M' < 'M', 'L'

      /**
       * The primary list of items.
       */
      + primary mandatory

      /**
       * The secondary list of items.
       */
      + secondary

   Example::

      + myactionbar
        - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/actionbar"
        + primary
          + button1
            - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/button"
