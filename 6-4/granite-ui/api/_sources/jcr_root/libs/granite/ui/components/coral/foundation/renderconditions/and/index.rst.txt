.. granite:servercomponent:: /libs/granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/renderconditions/and
   :rendercondition:

   The condition that renders the component when all of the sub conditions are deciding the component should be rendered.
   The child resources are evaluated recursively to finally come up with final decision.

   Example::

      + mybutton
        - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/button"
        + rendercondition
          - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/renderconditions/and"
          + condition1
            - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/renderconditions/simple"
            - expression = true
          + condition2
            - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/renderconditions/simple"
            - expression = true
