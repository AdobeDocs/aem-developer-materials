   A very simple component to print the title of the app.

   It has the following content structure:

   .. gnd:gnd::

      [granite:ShellTitle]

      /**
       * The title.
       *
       * e.g. "AEM Sites"
       */
      - jcr:title (String)

   Example::

      + mypage
        - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/shell/page"
        - jcr:title = "Page Title for <title>"
        + title
          - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/shell/title"
          - jcr:title = "Page Title"
        + content
          - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/container"
