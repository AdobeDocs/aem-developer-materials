   It has the following content structure at the layout resource:

   .. gnd:gnd::

      [granite:LayoutsMultiLayouts]

      /**
       * The actual layout to be displayed. The resource names of available layouts are matched with the value of this property.
       * If there is no match, then the first layout is used.
       */
      - layout (StringEL)

      /**
       * The layout names to skip rendering the empty layout.
       * This is mainly used to delegate the empty rendering to the actual layout itself.
       */
      - skipEmpty (String) multiple

      /**
       * Each children of this resource represents the available layout to be displayed.
       */
      + layouts

      /**
       * The layout to be displayed when the item data source is empty.
       */
      + empty

   The items of the layout are specified using :ref:`ItemDataSource <ItemDataSource>`.

      + mymultilayouts
        - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/container"
        + layout
          - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/layouts/multilayouts"
          - layout = '${state["cq.sites.childpages.layoutId"].string}'
          + empty
            - sling:resourceType = "my/datasource"
          + layouts
            + card
              - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/layouts/cardview"
              - stateId = "cq.sites.childpages"
              - layoutId = "card"

              - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/layouts/listview"
              - stateId = "cq.sites.childpages"
              - layoutId = "list"
            + columns
              - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/layouts/columnview"
