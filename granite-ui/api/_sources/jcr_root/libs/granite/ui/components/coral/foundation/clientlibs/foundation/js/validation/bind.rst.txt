Markup
======


.foundation-validation-bind
---------------------------

Indicates the element is participating in form validation.
When the ``<form>`` is invalid—when any of its fields is invalid—the ``disabled`` property of the element will be set to ``true``; ``false`` otherwise.
It is implied that only elements supporting ``disabled`` property can be used for this feature.
Typically they are ``<input type="submit">``, ``<button type="submit">``.

Selector Rule::

   form .foundation-validation-bind,
   .foundation-validation-bind[form]


Example
=======

.. code-block:: html

   <form>
     <label>Field 1 <input name="field1" required></label>
     <label>Field 2 <input name="field2" required></label>
     <button class="foundation-validation-bind" type="submit">Submit</button>
   </form>

In this case, the submit button will be enabled/disabled when the form is valid/invalid.
