.. granite:servercomponent:: /libs/granite/ui/components/foundation/renderconditions/not
   :rendercondition:
   :deprecated:

   The condition that renders the component when all of the sub conditions are false.
   The child resources are evaluated recursively to finally come up with final decision.

   Example::

      + mybutton
        - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/button"
        + rendercondition
          - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/renderconditions/not"
          + condition1
            - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/renderconditions/simple"
            - expression = false
          + condition2
            - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/renderconditions/simple"
            - expression = false
