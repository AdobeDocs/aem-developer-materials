Switcher
========

.. granite:servercomponent:: /libs/granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/mode/switcher

   Switcher is a container that leverages :doc:`/jcr_root/libs/granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/clientlibs/foundation/vocabulary/mode` vocabulary
   to show/hide the item according the active mode.
   When ``foundation-mode-change`` event is triggered, the item having the same mode will be shown; otherwise the item is hidden.

   It has the following content structure:

   .. gnd:gnd::

      [granite:ModeSwitcher] > granite:commonAttrs, granite:renderCondition, granite:container

      /**
       * The mode that is active initially; otherwise the first item is active.
       *
       * The item mode name is indicated by its resource name.
       */
      - active (StringEL)

      /**
       * The mode group that this component will be part of.
       */
      - group (String)

      /**
       * Put vertical margin to the root element.
       */
      - margin (Boolean)

      /**
       * Make the element maximized to fill the available space.
       */
      - maximized (Boolean)

   Example::

      + mymodeswitcher
        - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/mode/switcher"
        - group = "myapp-mytopic-mygroup"
        + items
          + default
            - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/container"
          + selection
            - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/container"

   In above example, there are two modes configured: ``default`` and ``selection``.
   Since there is no ``active`` specified at ``mymodecontainer`` resource, the first item (the default mode) is active.
   When ``foundation-mode-change`` is triggered with [mode = selection, group = myapp-mytopic-mygroup], the selection item will be shown and default item will be hidden.
