=======

.. granite:servercomponent:: /libs/granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/page/favicon

   FavIcon is a component that provides the favorite icon. It only makes sense to be included in the head of the page.

   It has the following content structure:

   .. gnd:gnd::

      [granite:PageFavIcon]

      /**
       * The URL of the icon.
       */
      - href (String) = '/libs/granite/core/content/login/favicon.ico'
