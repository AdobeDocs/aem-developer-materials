FixedColumns
============

.. granite:servercomponent:: /libs/granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/fixedcolumns

   The container to render each item as a column, which has a fixed width.
   This is mainly designed such that two columns fit a tablet device in landscape mode nicely.

   It has the following content structure:

   .. gnd:gnd::

      [granite:FixedColumns] > granite:commonAttrs, granite:renderCondition, granite:container

      /**
       * Put vertical margin to the root element.
       */
      - margin (Boolean)

      /**
       * Make the element maximized to fill the available space.
       */
      - maximized (Boolean)
