.. granite:servercomponent:: /libs/granite/ui/components/foundation/layouts/modal
   :layout:
   :deprecated:

   The layout to render the modal.
   It implements :doc:`/jcr_root/libs/granite/ui/components/foundation/clientlibs/foundation/vocabulary/toggleable` vocabulary.

   It has the following content structure at the layout resource:

   .. gnd:gnd::

      [granite:LayoutsModal]

      /**
       * ``true`` to render the build-in close button (usually at the top right of the modal).
       */
      - closable (BooleanEL) = 'true'

      /**
       * The type of the modal.
       */
      - type (StringEL) = 'default' < 'default', 'error', 'notice', 'success', 'help', 'info'

      /**
       * The layout style of the form. This property only makes sense when the main component is a form.
       *
       * vertical
       *    The form fields (and their labels) are laid out in vertical manner.
       * aligned
       *    The each form field is laid out side-by-side with its label.
       */
      - formStyle (String) = 'vertical' < 'vertical', 'aligned'

   It has the following content structure at the main resource:

   .. gnd:gnd::

      [granite:LayoutsModalMain]

      /**
       * The modal title.
       */
      - jcr:title (String) mandatory i18n

      /**
       * The footer area of the modal.
       */
      + footer

   The body of the modal is specified using :ref:`ItemDataSource <ItemDataSource>`.

   Each footer item can be any component. It supports a standard ``layoutConfig`` node with the following properties:

   .. gnd:gnd::

      [granite:LayoutsModalFooterItemLayoutconfig]

      /**
       * ``true`` to indicate that this item is used to close the modal.
       */
      - close (BooleanEL)

   Example::

      + mymodal
        - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/form"
        - jcr:title = "My Modal"
        + layout
          - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/layouts/modal"
          - formStyle = "vertical"
          - closable = true
          - type = "default"
        + items
          + item1
            - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/container"
          + item2
            - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/container"
        + footer
          + close
            - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/button"
            - text = "Cancel"
            + layoutConfig
              - close = true
          + submit
            - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/form/submit"
            - text = "Save"
