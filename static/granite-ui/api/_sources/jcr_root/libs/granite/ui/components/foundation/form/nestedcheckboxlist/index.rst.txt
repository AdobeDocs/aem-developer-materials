NestedCheckboxList
==================

.. granite:servercomponent:: /libs/granite/ui/components/foundation/form/nestedcheckboxlist
   :deprecated:

   NestedCheckboxList is a tree of checkboxes. When a checkbox is checked/unchecked:

   * Its descendant checkboxes are checked/unchecked also (i.e. the check/uncheck all concept)
   * Its ancestor checkboxes are updated to reflect theirs immediate children check status. When all the children are not checked/unchecked, the checkbox's will be rendered as partially checked.

   It has the following content structure:

   .. gnd:gnd::

      [granite:FormNestedCheckboxList] > granite:commonAttrs, granite:renderCondition

      /**
       * ``true`` to make each checkbox change to avoid checking/unchecking other checkboxes.
       */
      - disconnected (Boolean)

   The items (checkboxes) are specified using :ref:`ItemDataSource <ItemDataSource>`.

   Each checkbox can have a subnode named ``sublist`` to indicate the sublist of that checkbox:

   .. gnd:gnd::

      [granite:FormNestedCheckboxListSublist]

      /**
       * The sublist of the checkbox. The resource type would be another nestedcheckboxlist (or its derivative).
       */
      + sublist

   Example::

      + mynestescheckboxlist
        - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/form/nestedcheckboxlist"
        + items
          + level1
            - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/form/checkbox"
            - text = "Level 1"
            + sublist
              - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/form/nestedcheckboxlist"
              + items
                + level2a
                  - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/form/checkbox"
                  - text = "Level 2 A"
                + level2b
                  - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/form/checkbox"
                  - text = "Level 2 B"
