.. granite:servercomponent:: /libs/granite/ui/components/foundation/renderconditions/or
   :rendercondition:
   :deprecated:

   The condition that renders the component when any of the sub conditions is deciding the component should be rendered.
   The child resources are evaluated recursively to finally come up with final decision.

   Example::

      + mybutton
        - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/button"
        + rendercondition
          - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/renderconditions/or"
          + condition1
            - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/renderconditions/simple"
            - expression = true
          + condition2
            - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/renderconditions/simple"
            - expression = true
