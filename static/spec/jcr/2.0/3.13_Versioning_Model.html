	<P>Versioning enables a
	user to record the state of a node and its subgraph and restore that
	state at a later time. A repository that supports versioning may
	support either the complete set of versioning features, referred to
	as <I>full versioning</I>, or a specific subset defined here, which
	is referred to as <I>simple versioning</I>. This section describes
	the concepts, data structures and node types of the full versioning
	model as well as which parts of that model apply under simple
	versioning. Discussion of the versioning API and its behavior under
	both levels of support is found in ยง15 <I>Versioning</I>.</P>
