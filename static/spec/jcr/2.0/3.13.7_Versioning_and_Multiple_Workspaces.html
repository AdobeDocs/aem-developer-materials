	<P>As
	mentioned (see 3.13.2.5 <I>Base
	Version Reference</I> and 3.13.6.2 <I>Base
	Version</I>), under full versioning,
	corresponding versionable nodes in different workspaces all have a
	single common version history, though within that history each may
	have a distinct base version at any given time.</P>
	<P>The
	intended semantics of the correspondence relationship is that
	corresponding nodes represent copies of a common content structure
	which while identical at one level (i.e., as determined by
	<I>identifier</I>),
	can be maintained in distinct states (see ยง3.10.1.2 <I>Correspondence
	Semantics</I>).</P>
	<P>The
	relation of corresponding versionable nodes to the same version
	history reflects these semantics in that when different copies of
	the same content entity are changed and checked-in from different
	workspaces the resulting versions are all recorded within the same
	version graph and, depending on their individual base versions,
	extending that graph at different points.</P>
