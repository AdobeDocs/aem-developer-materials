	<P>Node types are used to
	enforce structural restrictions on the nodes and properties in a
	workspace by defining for each node, its required and permitted
	child nodes and properties.</P>
	<P>Every node has one
	declared <I>primary node type</I> and zero or more <I>mixin node
	types</I>. Primary node types are typically used to defined the core
	characteristics of a node, while mixin node types are used to add
	additional characteristics often related to specific repository
	functions or to metadata. 
	</P>
	<P>In a writable
	repository a node's primary type is first assigned upon node
	creation, while mixin types may be assigned on creation or during a
	node's lifetime. Repository implementations may vary as to how
	flexible they are in allowing changes to the primary or mixin node
	types assigned to a node.</P>
	<P>Each repository has a
	single, system-wide registry of node types. Typically, a repository
	will come with some implementation-determined set of built-in node
	types. Some of these types may be vendor-specific while others may
	be standard node types defined by JCR to support common use-cases
	(see ยง3.7.11 <I>Standard Application Node Types</I>) or repository
	features. Some repositories may further allow users to register new
	node types programmatically (see ยง19 <I>Node Type Management</I>).</P>
