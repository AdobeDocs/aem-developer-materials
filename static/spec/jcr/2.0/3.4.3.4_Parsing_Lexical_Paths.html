	<P>When parsing a lexical
	path, the parser must distinguish between name segments that are in
	expanded form and those that are in qualified form (see ยง3.2.5
	<I>Lexical Form of JCR Names</I>). When making this determination,
	the repository cannot assume that every namespace URI encountered in
	an expanded name will be registered within the repository.</P>
	<P>An otherwise valid
	path containing an expanded name with an unregistered <I>namespace
	URI </I>will always resolve into a valid internal representation of
	a path (i.e., an ordered list of path segments, see ยง3.4 <I>Paths</I>).
	Any errors that arise from passing such a path must therefore be as
	a result of further processing (not merely parsing) that depends on
	the semantics of the path and the context of use.</P>
	<P>However, a path
	containing a qualified name with an unregistered <I>prefix</I> will
	<I>not</I> resolve into a valid internal path representation. An
	attempt to pass such a path will therefore fail at the parsing
	stage.</P>
