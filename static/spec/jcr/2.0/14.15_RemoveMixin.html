	<P>If an attempt is made
	to remove the <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>mix:shareable</FONT></FONT>
	mixin node type from a node in a shared set the implementation may
	either throw a <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>ConstraintViolationException</FONT></FONT>
	or allow the removal and change the subgraph in some
	implementation-specific manner. One possibility is to replace the
	node with a copy that has no children (if this does not violate the
	node type restrictions of that node). Another possibility is to give
	the node a copy of all of its descendants (unless the resulting copy
	operation would be unfeasible, as would be the case if a share cycle
	were involved).</P>
