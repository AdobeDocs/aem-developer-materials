	<P>A privilege may be an
	<I>abstract privilege</I>. Abstract privileges cannot themselves be
	granted or denied, but can be individually tested and can be
	composed into aggregate privileges which are granted or denied.</P>
	<P>Abstract privileges
	facilitate application interoperability against repositories
	supporting different privilege granularities. For example, consider
	aggregate privilege <I>p</I> containing privileges <I>p1</I> and <I>p2</I>.
	In repository A, <I>p1</I> and <I>p2</I> are not abstract and can
	therefore be individually granted, whereas in repository B both <I>p1</I>
	and <I>p2</I> are abstract and cannot be individually granted. For
	both repositories, however, an application can test whether a user
	has privilege <I>p1</I>, even though in repository B, <I>p1</I> can
	only be acquired through non-abstract privilege <I>p</I>.</P>
	<P>A privilege can be
	both aggregate and abstract.</P>
