	<P>Initially, the session through which a
	lock is placed is the <I>owner</I> of that lock. This means the
	session has the power to alter the locked node and to remove the
	lock. In the case of open-scoped locks (as opposed to
	session-scoped, see ยง17.7 <I>Session-Scoped and Open-Scoped Locks</I>)
	control of the lock may be given to another session during the
	lifetime of that lock. In some implementations giving control of a
	lock to another session will remove control from the previous
	session, in others, more than one session may simultaneously own the
	same open-scoped lock. 
	</P>
	<P>Repositories may support
	client-specified lock owner information. If this is the case, the
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>jcr:lockOwner</FONT></FONT>
	property will be set to the value supplied upon lock creation, and
	will not change during the lifetime of the lock. Otherwise, when a
	lock is created, the <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>jcr:lockOwner</FONT></FONT>
	property is set to the user ID bound to the locking <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>Session</FONT></FONT>
	(that is, the string returned by <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>Session.getUserID</FONT></FONT>)
	or another implementation-dependent string identifying the user.</P>
	<P>In implementations that do not support
	client-specified lock owner information, when an open-scoped lock is
	moved to a new owner, or assigned an additional one (if supported),
	the <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>jcr:lockOwner</FONT></FONT>
	property may be automatically altered to reflect the change.</P>
	<P>Strictly speaking it is the session,
	not the user, that owns a particular lock at a particular time. The
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>jcr:lockOwner</FONT></FONT>
	property is used for informational purposes, so that a client
	application can, for example, display this information to other
	users. For this reason the user is sometimes informally referred to
	as the lock owner.</P>
	<P>In implementations that record the
	user ID in <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>jcr:lockOwner</FONT></FONT>,
	that user will not automatically have the ability to alter the
	locked node if accessing it through another session. Transfer (or,
	if supported, addition) of ownership must be done explicitly from
	one session to another and is not governed by the user ID associated
	with a session.</P>
