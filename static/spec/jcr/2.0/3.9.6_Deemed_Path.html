	<P>A descendant item of a
	shared set will have more than one valid path (assuming the shared
	set has at least two members). When the parent node or path of such
	a descendant item is requested, an implementation must choose a
	<I>deemed path</I> to return.</P>
	<P>How the deemed path is
	chosen and its stability both over time and across the set of
	descendent items is an implementation issue.</P>
	<P>In particular, it is
	permissible for an implementation to choose deemed paths for two
	sibling items where those paths differ by more than just the last
	element. It is also permissible for the deemed path of an item to
	change from one request to the next on the same item within the same
	session.</P>
	<P>Though most
	implementations are expected to support deemed paths which are more
	stable than this, flexibility of the deemed path is provided to
	facilitate implementations which would otherwise not be able to
	support shareable nodes.</P>
