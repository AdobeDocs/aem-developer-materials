	<P>For a given
	versionable node, one version within its version history is its <I>base
	version. </I>Conceptually, the base version of a versionable node is
	that version relative to which the current state of the checked-out
	versionable node constitutes a versionable change. 
	</P>
	<P>On check-in, the newly
	created version becomes a direct successor of the current base
	version and then itself becomes the <I>new</I> base version. 
	</P>
	<P>Under full versioning,
	corresponding versionable nodes in different workspaces, while
	sharing the same version history, may have distinct base versions
	within that history. This means that when one versionable node is
	checked-in, its version will become direct successor of a particular
	existing version but when one of its correspondees is checked in,
	that new version may become direct successor to a <I>different</I>
	existing version within the same version history.</P>
	<P>Under simple
	versioning the linearity of the version graph guarantees that the
	current base version is always the most recent version. On check-in
	it becomes the unique direct predecessor of the newly created
	version, which then becomes the new base version.</P>
	<P>Under full versioning,
	the presence of branches and merges means that the current base
	version for a given versionable node is not guaranteed to be the
	most recent version.</P>
