	<P>The JCR specification
	defines an abstract model and a Java API for data storage and
	related services commonly used by content-oriented applications. The
	target domain encompasses not only traditional content management
	systems but, more broadly, any application that must handle both
	unstructured digital assets and structured or semi-structured
	information.</P>
	<P>The repository model
	enables efficient access to both large binary objects and
	finely-structured hierarchical data through a simple, generic API
	and a robust and extensible object typing system. Additionally, many
	features that are traditionally custom-built on top of RDBMSs and
	file systems have been incorporated into the repository itself.
	These include support for query, access control, versioning, locking
	and observation. Standardized support for these services further
	enables applications that might not normally have access to such
	advanced features to take advantage of them, since they are built-in
	at the infrastructure level.</P>
