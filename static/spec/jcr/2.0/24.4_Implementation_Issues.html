	<P>JCR adapters built
	against some existing repositories may require a connection to the
	back-end repository to determine whether a feature is supported.
	Using methods on <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>Repository</FONT></FONT>
	(as opposed, for example, to methods on <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>Session</FONT></FONT>)
	to test support for a feature is therefore potentially problematic.
	However, several approaches are open to such adapters:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P>Establish a
		transient connection to the back-end (for example, using
		service-to-service authentication or as “guest”) to determine
		support for a feature.</P>
		<LI><P>Determine the
		features supported by the back-end upon application deployment, and
		store this in configuration file locally available to the JCR
		adapter at runtime.</P>
		<LI><P>Report the
		feature set supported by the type of back end, which may be a
		superset of the feature set supported by the specific instance of
		that back-end type.</P>
	</UL>
