	<P>Asynchronous
	observation enables an application to respond to changes made in a
	workspace as they occur.</P>
	<P>An application
	connects with the asynchronous observation mechanism by registering
	an event listener with the workspace. Listeners apply <I>per
	workspace</I>, not repository-wide; they only receive events for the
	workspace in which they are registered. An event listener is an
	application-specific class implementing the <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>EventListener</FONT></FONT>
	interface that responds to the stream of events to which it has been
	subscribed.</P>
	<P>This observation
	mechanism is <I>asynchronous</I> in that the operation that causes
	an event to be dispatched does not wait for a response to the event
	from the listener; execution continues normally on the thread that
	performed the operation.</P>
