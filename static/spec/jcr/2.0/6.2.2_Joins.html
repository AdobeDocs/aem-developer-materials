	<P>If the query has more
	than one selector, it also has one or more <I>joins</I> that
	transform the sets of nodes selected by each selector into a single
	set of <I>node-tuples</I>.</P>
	<P>The membership of the
	set of node-tuples depends on the <I>join type</I> and <I>join
	condition</I> of each join. The join type can be <I>inner</I>,
	<I>left-outer</I>, or <I>right-outer</I>. The join condition can
	test the equality of properties' values or the hierarchical
	relationship between nodes.</P>
	<P>If the query has <I>n</I>
	selectors, it has <I>n - 1</I> joins resulting in a set of <I>n</I>-tuples.
	For example, if the query has two selectors, it will have one join
	and produce a set of 2-tuples. If it has three selectors, it will
	have two joins and produce a set of 3-tuples. If it has only one
	selector, it will not have any joins and will produce a set of
	1-tuples, that is, the nodes selected by its only selector.</P>
	<P>Support for <I>joins</I>
	is optional. In a repository that <I>does not</I> support <I>joins</I>,
	the node-tuples produced are necessarily singletons. In other words,
	each node in the set produced by the (one and only) selector is
	converted directly into a node-tuple of size one. All further
	processing within the query evaluation operates on these tuples just
	as it would on tuples of size greater than one.</P>
