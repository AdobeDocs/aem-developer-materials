	<P>Activities provide a
	way of grouping together a set of logically related changes
	performed in a workspace and then later merging this set of changes
	into another workspace.</P>
	<P>Before starting to
	make a particular set of changes, the user sets the<I> current
	activity</I>. Each subsequent <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>checkout</FONT></FONT>
	made within the scope of that activity will associate that activity
	with that checked-out versionable, and will create a version that is
	tagged with the specified activity when that versionable is
	subsequently checked-in.</P>
	<P>Abstractly, therefore,
	an activity is a set of changes that produce new versions. However,
	if that set includes changes that produce more than one version
	within a particular version history, then those versions must all be
	on the same line of descent, that is, there must be a non-branching
	sequence of direct successor relationships beginning at the root
	version of the version history that reaches every version in the
	set. This ensures that there is always at most one “latest”
	version that contains all changes in a given version history for a
	given activity.</P>
