	<P>By indicating support
	for testable feature, a repository asserts that it fully conforms to
	the semantics of that feature as defined in this specification, with
	two possible exceptions:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P>aspects of the
		feature clearly indicated as being optional (i.e., <I>should</I>,
		<I>may</I>, <I>should not</I>), and</P>
		<LI><P>aspects of the
		feature testable by their own repository descriptors (for example,
		whether a repository supports joins is separately testable from
		whether it supports searches in general).</P>
	</UL>
	<P>However, to indicate
	that it supports a testable feature, a repository is only required
	to support that feature in some, not all, contexts. For example, a
	repository may restrict its support for a feature based on access
	control, path, or other criteria.</P>
