	<P>When a non-<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>BINARY</FONT></FONT>
	value is serialized during either system view or document view
	export, it is first converted to string form using standard value
	conversion, see ยง3.6.4 <I>Property Type Conversion. </I><FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>BINARY</FONT></FONT>
	values are encoded using Base64. The resulting string then undergoes
	any further changes required by the standard XML escaping rules<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote17anc" HREF="#sdfootnote17sym"><SUP>17</SUP></A></SUP>.</P>
	<P>In document view
	serialization, if the property being serialized is multi-valued (or
	if the implementation chooses to encode spaces in single-value
	properties as well, see below) then the value or values must be
	further encoded by escaping any occurrence of one of the four
	whitespace characters: space, tab, carriage return and line feed.
	The scheme used to encode these characters is the same as that
	described in ยง7.4 <I>Escaping of Names</I>. Note that in this
	restricted context, applying those escaping rules amounts to the
	following: a space becomes <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>_x0020_</FONT></FONT>,
	a tab becomes <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>_x0009_</FONT></FONT>,
	a carriage return becomes <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>_x000D_</FONT></FONT>,
	a line feed becomes <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>_x000A_</FONT></FONT>
	and any underscore (<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>_</FONT></FONT>)
	that occurs as the first character of a sequence that could be
	misinterpreted as an escape sequence becomes <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>_x005f_</FONT></FONT>.</P>
	<P>Finally, in document
	view export, the value of the attribute representing a multi-value
	property is constructed by concatenating the results of the above
	escaping into a space-delimited list.</P>
	<P>In document view
	export (though not in system view), if multi-value property
	serialization is supported (see ยง7.3.3 <I>Multi-Value Properties</I>)
	then a mechanism must be adopted whereby upon re-import the
	distinction between multi- and single- value properties is not lost.
	One option is that escaping of space literals must be applied to the
	value of all single-value properties as well. Another option is that
	when an XML document is imported in document view, each attribute is
	assumed to be a single-value property unless out-of-band information
	defines it to be multi-valued (for example, if the applicable node
	type defines the property as multi-valued or the XML document is
	associated with a schema definition that indicates that the
	attribute is a list value). The approach taken is
	implementation-specific.</P>
	<P>Note that the value of
	a <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>jcr:xmlcharacters</FONT></FONT>
	property used to represent XML text (see ยง7.3.1 <I>XML Text</I>) is
	not space-escaped, regardless of the prevailing multi-value property
	serialization policy.</P>
