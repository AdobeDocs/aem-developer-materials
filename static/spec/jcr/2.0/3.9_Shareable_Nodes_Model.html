	<P>The ability to address
	the same piece of data via more than one path is a common feature of
	many content storage systems. In JCR this feature is supported
	through <I>shareable nodes</I>.</P>
	<P>Two or more shareable
	nodes in the same workspace may belong to a shared set. Each node
	within that set has its own unique path within the workspace but all
	share exactly the same set of child nodes and properties. This means
	that while the shared nodes are distinct from a path perspective,
	they are effectively the same node for purposes of operations that
	access their common subgraph.</P>
