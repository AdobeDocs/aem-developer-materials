	<P>If a lock applies to a
	node (i.e., the node either holds the lock or is a descendant of a
	node holding a deep lock), then to all sessions except the
	lock-owning session, the same restrictions apply with respect to the
	node as would apply if the node were protected (see ยง3.7.2.2
	<I>Protected</I>). 
	</P>
	<P>Removing a node is
	considered an alteration of <I>its parent</I>. This means that a
	node within the scope of a lock may be removed by a session that is
	not an owner of that lock, assuming no other restriction prevents
	the removal. Similarly, a locked node and its subgraph may be moved
	by a non-lock-owning session if no restriction prevents the
	alteration of the source and destination parent nodes.</P>
	<P>
	Locked nodes can always be read and copied by any session with
	sufficient access privileges.</P>
	<P>When an action is
	prevented due to a lock, a <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>LockException
	</FONT></FONT>is thrown either immediately or on the
	subsequent <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>save</FONT></FONT>.
	Implementations may differ on which of these behaviors is used to
	enforce locking.</P>
	<P>There is at most one
	lock on any node at one time.</P>
