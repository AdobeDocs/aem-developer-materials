	<P>The privileges granted
	to a user can be controlled by assigning <I>access control policies</I>
	to nodes. The content and semantics of these policies are
	implementation specific and may be based on any mechanism, including
	access control lists or role-responsibility assignments. JCR does
	not expose the internals of policies, nor does it provide a
	mechanism for defining them. However, it does provide a marker
	interface <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>AccessControlPolicy</FONT></FONT>
	and two derived interfaces <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>NamedAccessControlPolicy</FONT></FONT>
	and <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>AccessControlList</FONT></FONT>
	(see ยง16.6 <I>Access Control Lists</I>). Furthermore, JCR provides
	means to:</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P>Find which
		polices are available to be bound to a node.</P>
		<LI><P>Bind a policy to
		a node.</P>
		<LI><P>Get the policies
		bound to a given node (including transient modifications).</P>
		<LI><P>Get the policies
		that affect access to a given node.</P>
		<LI><P>Unbind a policy
		from a node.</P>
	</UL>
	<P>In addition to these
	methods, any <I>effect</I> that a policy has on a node is always
	reflected in the information returned by the privilege discovery
	methods (see ยง16.2.7 <I>Testing Privileges</I>). Note that the
	<I>scope</I> of the effect of an access control policy may not be
	identical to the node to which that policy is bound (see ยง16.4.2
	<I>Binding a Policy to a Node</I>).</P>
