									In repositories that have multiple workspaces, a node in one workspace may have <i>corresponding nodes</i> in other workspaces.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									As mentioned in 4.10.2 Multiple Workspaces and Corresponding Nodes, a node's corresponding node is defined as follows:
								</p>
							
						
					
				
			
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p class="c5">
					A node's corresponding nodes are those with the same <i>correspondence identifier</i>.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="c5">
					The correspondence identifier of a referenceable node is its UUID.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="c5">
					The correspondence identifier of a non-referenceable node with at least one referenceable ancestor is the pair consisting of the UUID of its nearest referenceable ancestor and its relative path from that ancestor.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="c5">
					The correspondence identifier of a non-referenceable node with no referenceable ancestor is its absolute path.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
			
				
					
						
							
								<p class="c5">
									Note also that (as stated in 4.9 Referenceable Nodes) if a repository has a workspace with a referenceable root node then <i>all</i> its workspaces must have referenceable root nodes <i>and</i> those root nodes must all have the same UUID.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Apart from having the same correspondence identifier, corresponding nodes need have nothing else in common. They can have entirely different properties and child nodes, for example.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									While a node <i>may</i> have a corresponding node in another workspace, it is not <i>required</i> to.
								</p>
