									The set of available event types is small, consisting of only five types: <b>NODE_ADDED</b>, <b>NODE_REMOVED</b>, <b>PROPERTY_ADDED, PROPERTY_REMOVED</b> and <b>PROPERTY_CHANGED</b>. The intent of the event notification system is to describe, for every persistent operation, the resulting state change in the workspace, and not necessarily the operational steps performed by the client that lead to that change. The set of five event types and the bundling of those events is sufficient to describe any state change and make that change correctly interpretable by the consumer of the events. The following describes the events generated as a result of a number of common operations. Note that the following describes the events that would be generated when the change caused by the operation in question is persisted.
