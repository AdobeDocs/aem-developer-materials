									The user who places a lock on a node is called the lock owner. The lock owner is identified by the user ID bound to the <b>Session</b> through which the node in question was accessed (that is, the string returned by <b>Session.getUserID</b>). The user ID is recorded in the property <b>jcr:lockOwner</b> of the lock holding node. The lock owner's ID is provided for informational purposes only, it is not used in testing whether a particular user has any permissions with respect to the lock (this is governed purely by whether the <b>Session</b> holds the applicable lock token, see below).
