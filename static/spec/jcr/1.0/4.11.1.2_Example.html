									The following diagram illustrates a possible repository architecture.
								</p>

									This diagram shows a repository that supports versioning and contains two workspaces. The version storage is represented by the area in the bottom. It contains a version history for each versionable node in the repository. The versionable nodes in the workspaces are shown in various shadings. The nonversionable nodes are shown in white.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									All versionable nodes are referenceable, though not all referenceable nodes are versionable (for example the node <i>03</i> in <b>WS</b><b><sub>1</sub></b> is referenceable, because it has a UUID, but it is not versionable). Both <b>WS</b><b><sub>1</sub></b> and <b>WS</b><b><sub>2</sub></b> also contain nonreferenceable nodes (the nodes <b>c</b> below <i>01</i>).
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									In the diagram the version histories are represented by stacked circles of differing shades. Each versionable node shares its version history with its corresponding node in the other workspace.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									At any given time a particular workspace may hold nodes based on various versions stored in version storage. In the diagram, <b>WS</b><sub><b>1</b></sub> holds nodes based on the “light gray” version of the nodes <i>00</i>, <i>01</i> and <i>02</i>. <b>WS</b><sub><b>2</b></sub>, in contrast, has nodes based on the “dark gray” version of <i>00</i>, the “light gray” version of <i>01</i> and the “dotted” version of <i>02</i>.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Note that for the purposes of illustration, each version history is depicted as containing three versions. This is a simplification; in an actual system the version histories of distinct nodes may differ. Furthermore, in this picture, parent child relations within the version storage are not shown. See <a href="8.2_Versioning.html">8.2</a> <i>Versioning</i> for a more detailed description.
