									Support for versioning is an optional feature. The versioning system is built on top of the system of workspaces and referenceable nodes described above.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									In a repository that supports versioning, a workspace may contain both <i>versionable</i> and <i>nonversionable</i> nodes. A node is versionable if and only if it has been assigned the <i>mixin type</i> <b>mix:versionable</b>, otherwise it is nonversionable. Repositories that do not support versioning will simply not provide this mixin type, whereas repositories that do support versioning must provide it. The type <b>mix:versionable</b> is a subtype of <b>mix:referenceable</b>, so if a node is versionable it is automatically also referenceable and thus has a UUID.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Being versionable means that at any given time the node's state can be saved for possible future recovery. This saved state is called a <i>version</i> and the action of saving it is called <i>checking in</i>.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Versions exist as part of a <i>version history</i>. Within a version history, the versions form a <i>version graph</i> that describes the predecessor/successor relations among versions of a particular versionable node.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Version histories and their contained versions are stored in version storage. There is one version storage per repository, though it is exposed in each workspace as a special protected subtree below the node <b>/jcr:system/jcr:versionStorage</b>.
								</p>
