								<p class="c5">
									When a <b>save</b> is performed on an <b>Item</b>, any changes recorded for that <b>Item</b> in the <b>Session</b> are persisted and the record of that change in the <b>Session</b> is removed. From the perspective of the application, the apparent state of the <b>Item</b> itself does not change (apart from the values returned by <b>isNew</b> or <b>isModified</b>), since the item has reflected the changes since they were initially made. If one or more of the pending changes cause an exception to be thrown on <b>save</b>, then <i>no</i> pending changes are saved, not even those which did not cause the problem. In this case the set of pending changes recorded on the session is left unaffected.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									When a <b>refresh(false)</b> is performed on an <b>Item</b>, any pending changes recorded for that <b>Item</b> in the <b>Session</b> are discarded and the state of the <b>Item</b> object reverts to its current saved state in the workspace. If an exception occurs on <b>refresh</b>, the set of pending changes recorded on the session is left unaffected and <b>Item</b> state is similarly unaffected.
