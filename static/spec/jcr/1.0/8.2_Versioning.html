								<p class="c5">
									A compliant content repository may support versioning. This feature allows the state of a node to be recorded in such a way that it can later be restored. The versioning system is modelled after the Workspace Versioning and Configuration Management (WVCM) API defined by JSR 147.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Whether a particular implementation supports versioning can be determined by querying the repository descriptor table with <b>Repository.getDescriptor("</b><b>OPTION_VERSIONING_SUPPORTED")</b> (a return value of <b>true</b> indicates support for versioning, see 6.1.1.1 Repository Descriptors).
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									A versioning repository has, in addition to one or more workspaces, a special <i>version storage</i> area. The version storage consists of <i>version histories</i>. Versionable nodes in different workspaces share the same version history if and only if they have the same UUID (see <a href="4.10.2_Multiple_Workspaces_and_Corresponding_Nodes.html">4.10.2</a> <i>Multiple Workspaces and Corresponding Nodes</i>).
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									A version history is a collection of versions connected to one another by the <i>successor</i> relationship. A new version is added to the version history of a versionable node when one of its workspace instances is <i>checked-in</i>. Every new version is attached to the version history as the successor of one (or more) of the existing versions. The result is that a version history is a directed acyclic graph of versions, where the arcs in the graph represent the successor relation.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									The version storage objects are themselves defined as nodes. Though there is only one version storage per repository, the version storage data is reflected in each workspace as a special, protected, sub-tree of nodes of types <b>nt:versionHistory</b> and <b>nt:version</b> (see <a href="8.2.2_Version_Storage.html">8.2.2</a> <i>Version Storage</i>).
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									When a versionable node is <i>checked-in</i> (using <b>Node.checkin</b>) a new version is created in the version history of that node. The versionable node is also set to be read-only. In order to alter it with a regular write method, it must be checked-out (using <b>Node.checkout</b>). A versionable node can also be restored to the state recorded in one of its versions using <b>Node.restore</b>.
