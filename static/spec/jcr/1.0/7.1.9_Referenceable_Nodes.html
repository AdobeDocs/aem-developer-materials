								<p class="c5">
									A node that is referenceable has an independent identity from its position in the workspace hierarchy (by virtue of its UUID): it maintains its identity regardless of where it is moved in the hierarchy.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Non-referenceable nodes, on the other hand, are intrinsically tied to their position in the hierarchy relative to their nearest referenceable ancestor. If a non-referenceable node is moved from its position it becomes, in effect, a different node.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c14">
									Consequently, a referenceable node and its non-referenceable sub-nodes form a natural unit within the WS hierarchy. It is this unit that is respected during a <b>save</b>, <b>update</b> and <b>merge</b>.
