										<b>checkin()</b>
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										Creates a new version with a system generated name and returns that version. The <b>jcr:isCheckedOut</b> property of this node is set to <b>false</b> thus putting the node into the <i>checked-in</i> state. This means that this node and its <i>connected non-versionable subtree</i> become read-only. A node's connected non-versionable subtree is the set of non-versionable descendant nodes reachable from that node through child links without encountering any versionable nodes. In other words, the read-only status flows down from the checked-in node along every child link until either a versionable node is encountered or an item with no children is encountered.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										Read-only status means that an item cannot be altered by the client using standard API methods (<b>addNode</b>, <b>setProperty</b>, etc.). The only exceptions to this rule are the <b>restore</b><sup><b><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote11anc" href="#sdfootnote11sym" id="sdfootnote11anc"><sup>11</sup></a></b></sup>, <b>Node.merge</b> and <b>Node.update</b> operations; these do not respect read-only status due to check-in. Note that <b>remove</b> of a read-only node is possible, as long as its parent is not read-only (since removal is an alteration of the parent node).
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										See <a href="8.2.5_Check_In.html">8.2.5</a> <i>Check In</i> for more details.

									<p class="c5">
										If this node is not versionable, an <b>UnsupportedRepositoryOperationException</b> is thrown.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										A <b>VersionException</b> is thrown or if a child item of this node has an <b>OnParentVersion</b> status of <b>ABORT</b>. This includes the case where an unresolved merge failure exists on this node, as indicated by the presence of the <b>jcr:mergeFailed</b> property.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										If <b>checkin</b> succeeds, the change to the <b>jcr:checkedOut</b> property is automatically saved (there is no need to do an additional <b>save</b>).
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										If there are unsaved changes pending on this node, an <b>InvalidItemStateException</b> is thrown.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										A <b>LockException</b> is thrown if a lock prevents the checkin.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										A <b>RepositoryException</b> is thrown if an error occurs.

This method puts the node into the <i>checked-out</i> state, making it and its connected non-versionable subtree no longer read-only (see <b>checkin</b>, above, for an explanation of the term “connected non-versionable subtree”).
