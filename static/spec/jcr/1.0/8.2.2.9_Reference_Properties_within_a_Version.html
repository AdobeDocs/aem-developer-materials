								<p class="c5">
									When a <b>REFERENCE</b> property is stored as part of the frozen state of a version, the referential integrity requirement is lifted. For example, given the following situation:
								</p>
							
						
					
				
			
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p class="c5">
					Nodes <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> in a workspace <b>WS</b> (i.e., in the workspace proper, not in the protected version storage subtree)
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="c5">
					<b>A</b> is (at least) versionable.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="c5">
					<b>B</b> is (at least) referenceable.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="c5">
					<b>A</b> has <b>REFERENCE</b> property <b>P</b>.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="c5">
					<b>P</b> has an <i>OnParentVersion</i> setting of <b>COPY</b>.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p class="c5">
					<b>P</b> holds a reference to <b>B</b>. <b>B</b> has no other references pointing to it.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
			
				
					
						
							
								<p class="c5">
									Assuming that <b>A</b> is checked in.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									When <b>A</b> is checked in, <b>P</b> will be recorded as part of the frozen state of the newly created version <b>A'</b> by being copied to version storage as a property <b>P'</b> of <b>A'</b>.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									At this point <b>B</b> cannot be removed from the workspace because it has a reference (<b>P</b>) pointing to it. However, if <b>P</b> is removed from <b>A</b>, then <b>B</b> can be removed. Because referential integrity is not enforced for frozen reference properties in version storage, the reference from <b>P'</b> will not prevent the removal of <b>B</b>. This is despite the fact that <b>P'</b> does appear in the same workspace as <b>B</b> (though only in the special version storage subtree at <b>/jcr:system/jcr:versionStorage</b>). Note that this also means that a call to <b>getReferences</b> on <b>B</b> will <i>not</i> return <b>P'</b>.
