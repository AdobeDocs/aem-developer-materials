									In certain circumstances a “chicken and egg” problem may arise due to a cycle of <b>REFERENCE</b> properties when attempting to restore a node that has been removed.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									For example, let us say that there is a node <b>/A</b> with child nodes <b>/A/B</b> and <b>/A/C</b>. Furthermore let there be <b>REFERENCE</b> properties <b>/A/B/X /A/C/Y</b> such that <b>X</b> refers to <b>/A/C</b> and <b>Y</b> refers to <b>/A/B</b>. Now assume that <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> and <b>C</b> are first checked-in (thus creating versions of all three nodes) and then <b>B</b> and <b>C</b> are deleted from the workspace.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									In order to restore <b>B</b> or <b>C</b> the other must be restored first, since the reference properties <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> both require the existence of the node to which they refer. This is the “chicken and egg” problem.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									To deal with such situations the method
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									<b>Workspace.restore(Version[] versions,<br>
									boolean removeExisting)</b>
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									is provided. This method allows the client to simultaneously restore two or more versions. In this case the client must first find the <b>Version</b> objects (call them <b>Va</b>, <b>Vb</b> and <b>Vc</b>) that correspond to the versions of <b>A</b>, <b>B</b> and <b>C</b> that are to be restored and calling
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									<b>ws.restore(new Version[]{Va, Vb, Vc}, removeExisting)</b>
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Notice that in order to restore <b>B</b> and <b>C</b>, the previous version of <b>A</b> must also be restored because its state contains the child links to <b>B</b> and <b>C</b>.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									The <b>removeExisting</b> flag governs what happens in cases of UUID collision.
