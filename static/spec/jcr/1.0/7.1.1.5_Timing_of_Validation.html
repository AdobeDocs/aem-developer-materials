								<p class="c5">
									For those write methods that require a <b>save</b>, implementers have considerable flexibility in deciding whether a particular validation is to be performed immediately during the invocation of the write method or later on <b>save</b>. For example, in the case <b>Node.addNode</b>, an implementer might immediately check that the path given is valid while postponing validation of node type constraints until <b>save</b>-time.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									The <i>suggestion</i> is that an implementation should perform each validation as soon as possible, given the underlying design of the repository.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									The <i>requirement</i> is that an implementation must prohibit the emergence of a persistent state in violation the validation rules defined by this specification. Therefore at the latest, all validation must be done on <b>save</b>.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									In the context of a particular change to an item, we often refer to <b>save</b> generically, as in, “the change will be persisted on <b>save</b>”. Such statements refer to any invocation of <b>save</b>, (<b>Session.save</b> or <b>Item.save</b>) that include the changed item within its scope.
