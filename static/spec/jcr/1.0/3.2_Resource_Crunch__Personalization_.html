								<p class="c5">
									PersonalizeIt Software Corp., a vendor of personalization and portal software, needs to gain access to meta-information and content that is aggregated and managed by content management systems.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Since, historically, the CM market has been quite diverse, PersonalizeIt has had to integrate into many different proprietary APIs. This meant that PersonalizeIt had to spend a large amount of time familiarizing their developers with these APIs and had to maintain compatibility with all the different APIs as the various CM vendors' products evolved.

									Since the adoption of this specification, PersonalizeIt offers a standard interface to compliant repositories. Therefore, they no longer have to maintain dozens of proprietary integrations and can concentrate on their core competency.
