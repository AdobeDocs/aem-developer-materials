								<p class="c5">
									Every node <i>must</i> have one and only one <i>primary node type</i>. The primary node type defines the names, types and other characteristics of the properties and child nodes that a node is allowed (or required) to have. Every node has a special property called <b>jcr:primaryType</b> that records the name of its primary node type.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									In addition to its primary node type, a node <i>may</i> also have one or more <i>mixin types</i>. These are node type definitions that can mandate extra characteristics (i.e., more child nodes, properties and their respective names and types) for a particular node in addition to those enforced by its primary node type. When a node is assigned a mixin node type, it acquires a special multi-value property called <b>jcr:mixinTypes</b> that records its mixin node types.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Level 1 of the specification provides methods for discovering the node types of existing nodes, and for discovering and reading the definitions of node types available in the repository.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Level 2 of the specification provides methods for assigning primary and mixin node types to nodes.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									The specification does not attempt to provide methods for defining, creating or managing primary or mixin node types.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									This specification also provides a set of predefined primary and mixin node types; some required and some optional. See <a href="6.7_Node_Types.html">6.7</a> <i>Node Types</i>.
