										Validates all pending changes currently recorded in this <b>Session</b>. If validation of <i>all</i> pending changes succeeds, then this change information is cleared from the <b>Session</b>. If the <b>save</b> occurs outside a transaction, the changes are persisted and thus made visible to other <b>Session</b>s. If the <b>save</b> occurs within a transaction, the changes are not persisted until the transaction is committed (see <a href="8.1_Transactions.html">8.1</a> <i>Transactions</i> for more details).

										If validation fails, then no pending changes are saved and they remain recorded on the <b>Session</b>. There is no best-effort or partial <b>save</b>.

										An <b>ItemExistsException</b> will be thrown if any of the changes to be persisted would be prevented by the presence of an already existing item in the workspace.

										An <b>InvalidItemStateException</b> is thrown if any of the changes to be persisted conflicts with a change already persisted through another session and the implementation is such that this conflict can only be detected at <b>save</b>-time and therefore was not detected earlier, at change-time.

										If <b>keepChanges</b> is <b>true</b> then pending changes are not discarded but items that do not have changes pending have their state refreshed to reflect the current saved state, thus revealing changes made by other sessions.
