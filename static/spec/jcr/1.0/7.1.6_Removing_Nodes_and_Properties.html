									Removing a node or property is done with the <b>Item.remove</b> method:
								</p>
							
						
					
					
						<table border="1" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0">
							
							
							<tr>
								<td colspan="2" valign="top">
									<p class="c12">
										javax.jcr.<br>
										<b>Item</b>
									</p>
								</td>
							</tr>

										<b>void</b>

								<td>
									<p class="c5">
										<b>remove()</b>
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										Removes <b>this</b> item (and its subtree).
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										To persist a removal, a <b>save</b> must be performed that includes the (former) parent of the removed item within its scope.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										A <b>ReferentialIntegrityException</b> will be thrown on <b>save</b> if this item or an item in its subtree is currently the target of a <b>REFERENCE</b> property located in this workspace but outside this item's subtree and the current <b>Session</b> has read access to that <b>REFERENCE</b> property.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										An <b>AccessDeniedException</b> will be thrown on <b>save</b> if this item or an item in its subtree is currently the target of a <b>REFERENCE</b> property located in this workspace but outside this item's subtree and the current <b>Session</b> <i>does not</i> have read access to that <b>REFERENCE</b> property.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										A <b>ConstraintViolationException</b> will be thrown either immediately (by this method), or on <b>save</b>, if removing this item would violate a node type or implementation-specific constraint. Implementations may differ on when this validation is performed.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										A <b>VersionException</b> will be thrown either immediately (by this method), or on <b>save</b>, if the parent node of this item is versionable and checked-in or is non-versionable but its nearest versionable ancestor is checked-in. Implementations may differ on when this validation is performed.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										A <b>LockException</b> will be thrown either immediately (by this method), or on <b>save</b>, if a lock prevents the removal of this item. Implementations may differ on when this validation is performed.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										A <b>RepositoryException</b> is thrown if another error occurs.

								<p class="c5">
									A property can also be removed by setting its value to <b>null</b>. When this is done, the <b>null</b> parameter must be cast to a non-array type for single value properties and an array type for multi-value properties.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Note that setting a multi-value property to an array containing <b>null</b> values is different from setting it to a <b>null</b> cast to an array type. In the former case, all <b>null</b> values within the array are removed and the array is compacted to include only non-null values even if this results in a multi-value property being set to an empty array. In the latter case the entire property is removed. For example,
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									<b>p.setValue((String[])null)</b>
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									would remove property <b>p</b>, whereas
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									<b>p.setValue(new String[]{"a", null, "b"})</b> would set <b>p</b> to <b>["a","b"]</b>
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									and
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									<b>p.setValue(new String[]{null})</b> would set <b>p</b> to the empty array, <b>[]</b>.
								</p>
