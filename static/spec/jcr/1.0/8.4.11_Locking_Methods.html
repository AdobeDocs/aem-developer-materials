									The methods for locking, unlocking and querying the locking status of a node are found in the <b>Node</b> interface itself:

										<b>Lock</b>

										<b>lock(boolean isDeep, boolean isSessionScoped)</b>
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										Places a lock on this node. If successful, this node is said to <i>hold</i> the lock.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										If <b>isDeep</b> is <b>true</b> then the lock <i>applies</i> to this node and all its descendant nodes; if <b>false</b>, the lock applies only to this, the holding node.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										If <b>isSessionScoped</b> is <b>true</b> then this lock will expire upon the expiration of the current session (either through an automatic or explicit <b>Session.logout</b>); if <b>false</b>, this lock does not expire until explicitly unlocked or automatically unlocked due to a implementation-specific limitation, such as a timeout.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										Returns a <b>Lock</b> object reflecting the state of the new lock and including a lock token.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										The lock token is also automatically added to the set of lock tokens held by the current <b>Session</b>.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										If successful, then the property <b>jcr:lockOwner</b> is created and set to the value of <b>Session.getUserID</b> for the current session and the property <b>jcr:lockIsDeep</b> is set to the value passed in as <b>isDeep</b>. These changes are persisted automatically; there is no need to call <b>save</b>.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										Note that it is possible to lock a node even if it is checked-in (the lock-related properties will be changed despite the checked-in status). See <a href="8.2_Versioning.html">8.2</a> <i>Versioning</i> for an explanation of “checked-in” status.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										If this node is not of mixin node type <b>mix:lockable</b> then a <b>LockException</b> is thrown.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										If this node is already locked (either because it holds a lock or a lock above it applies to it), a <b>LockException</b> is thrown.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										If <b>isDeep</b> is <b>true</b> and a descendant node of this node already holds a lock, then a <b>LockException</b> is thrown.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										If the current session does not have sufficient permissions to place the lock, an <b>AccessDeniedException</b> is thrown.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										An <b>InvalidItemStateException</b> is thrown if this node has pending unsaved changes.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										An <b>UnsupportedRepositoryOperationException</b> is thrown if this implementation does not support locking.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										A <b>RepositoryException</b> is thrown if another error occurs.

									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										If this <b>Session</b> (the one through which this <b>Node</b> was acquired) holds the lock token for this lock, then the returned <b>Lock</b> object contains that lock token (accessible through <b>Lock.getLockToken</b>). If this <b>Session</b> does not hold the applicable lock token, then the returned <b>Lock</b> object will not contain the lock token (its <b>Lock.getLockToken</b> method will return <b>null</b>).

										If this node does not currently hold a lock or holds a lock for which this <b>Session</b> does not have the correct lock token, then a <b>LockException</b> is thrown. Note however that the system may give permission to some users to unlock locks for which they do not have the lock token. Typically such “lock-superuser” capability is intended to facilitate administrational clean-up of orphaned open-scoped locks.
