									Throughout this specification we often mention the distinction between <i>transient</i> and <i>persistent</i> levels. The persistent level refers to the (one or more) workspaces that make up the actual content storage of the repository. The transient level refers to in-memory storage associated with a particular <b>Session</b> object.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									In these discussions we usually assume that operations occur outside the context of transactions; it is assumed that <b>save</b> and other workspace-altering methods immediately effect changes to the persistent layer, causing those changes to be made visible to other sessions.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									<i>This is not the case, however, once transactions are introduced</i>. Within a transaction, changes made by <b>save</b> (or other, workspace-direct, methods) are transactionalized and are only persisted and published (made visible to other sessions), upon commit of the transaction. A rollback will, conversely, revert the effects of any saves or workspace-direct methods called within the transaction.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Note, however, that changes made in the transient storage are <i>not</i> recorded by a transaction. This means that a rollback will not revert changes made to the transient storage of the <b>Session</b>. After a rollback the <b>Session</b> object state will still contain any pending changes that were present before the rollback.
								</p>
