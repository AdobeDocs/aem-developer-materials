									Because modifications in the transient layer are not transactionalized, the possibility exists for some implementations to allow a <b>Session</b> to be shared across transactions. This possibility arises because in JTA, an <b>XAResource</b> may be successively associated with different global transactions and in many implementations the natural mapping will be to make the <b>Session</b> implement the <b>XAResource</b>. The following code snippet illustrates how an <b>XAResource</b> may be shared across two global transactions:
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c12">
									// Associate the resource (our Session) with a global<br>
									// transaction xid1<br>
									res.start(xid1, TMNOFLAGS);<br>
									<br>
									// Do something with res, on behalf of xid1<br>
									// ...
								</p>
							
							
								<p>
									<br>
									// Suspend work on this transaction<br>
									res.end(xid1, TMSUSPEND);<br>
									<br>
									// Associate (the same!) resource with another<br>
									// global transaction xid2<br>
									res.start(xid2, TMNOFLAGS);<br>
									<br>
									// Do something with res, on behalf of xid2<br>
									// ...<br>
									<br>
									// End work<br>
									res.end(xid2, TMSUCCESS);<br>
									<br>
									// Resume work with former transaction<br>
									res.start(xid1, TMRESUME);<br>
									<br>
									// Commit work recorded when associated with xid2<br>
									res.commit(xid2, true);<br><br>
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									<br>In cases where the <b>XAResource</b> corresponds to a <b>Session</b> (that is, probably most implementations), items that have been obtained in the context of <b>xid1</b> would still be valid when the <b>Session</b> is effectively associated with <b>xid2</b>. In other words, all transactions working on the same <b>Session</b> would share the transient items obtained through that <b>Session</b>.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									In those implementations that adopt a copy-on-read approach to transient storage (see <a href="7.1.3.4_Seeing_Changes_Made_by_Other_Sessions.html">7.1.3.4</a> <i>Seeing Changes Made by Other Sessions</i>) this will mean that the transient layer reflects an unchanged item's state <i>in the transaction<br>
									context in which the item was acquired</i>. As soon as an item is refreshed or changed, the session will then reflect the state of that item in the transaction context within which that refresh or change took place.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Some implementers may choose to circumvent any problems with shared transient items by undoing changes inside the transient layer when a session is disassociated from a global transaction. This is however, outside the scope of this specification.
