   ``OpenPrompt`` is success response handler that shows a prompt to the user to open a resource.
   This is mainly used in creation form, where the user is given a choice to open the newly created resource.

   It is implemented in the client by :doc:`../../../clientlibs/foundation/js/form/response/ui/success/foundation.prompt.open`.

   It has the following content structure:

   .. gnd:gnd::

      [granite:FormResponsesOpenPrompt] > granite:commonAttrs

      /**
       * The URI Template to open the resource.
       */
      - open (StringEL)

      /**
       * The URI Template for redirection.
       */
      - redirect (StringEL)

      /**
       * The title of the prompt.
       */
      - jcr:title (String) i18n

      /**
       * The text of the prompt.
       */
      - text (String) i18n

   Example::

      + myform
        - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/form"
        - method = "post"
        - action = "/my/new/resource"
        - foundationForm = true
        + successresponse
          - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/form/responses/openprompt"
          - open = "/bin/wcmcommand?cmd=open&_charset_=utf-8&path={Path}"
          - redirect = "/sites.html${granite:encodeURIPath(requestPathInfo.suffix)}"
          - jcr:title = "Site Created"
        + items
          + field1
