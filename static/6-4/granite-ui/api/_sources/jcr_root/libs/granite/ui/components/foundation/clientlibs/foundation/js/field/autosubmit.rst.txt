The form has a very nice feature where when everything is configured properly, pressing "enter" in the text field will submit the form.
But unfortunately there is no similar feature for checkbox. So this autosubmit is a concept when the input change, the form will be submitted automatically.

The typical use case would be in search form when changing the checkbox should update the search result straight away.
