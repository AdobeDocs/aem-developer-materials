***************************
Hiding Resource Dynamically
***************************

There is a use case where you need to exclude a component from being rendered.
Typical example would be to render a submit button based on whether the current user has a privilege to create or modify a resource.

To achieve this, Granite UI offers two mechanics:

.. toctree::
   :titlesonly:
   :glob:

   filteringresourcewrapper
   rendercondition


Usage Recommendation
====================

Since RenderCondition uses Sling include to check the condition, it is slower compared to FilteringResourceWrapper.
FilteringResourceWrapper is also more transparent to its client.
Because of this, FilteringResourceWrapper is recommended compared to RenderCondition when it is usable.

At the flip side, FilteringResourceWrapper depends on :doc:`el` to express the condition.
So naturally what can be done is depending on the current supported feature of EL.

Contrast this to RenderCondition, where the condition logic is a RT.
So any condition logic can be implemented accordingly.
