       * Indicates the data property of ``foundation-collection-action``. It will be converted to JSON.
       *
       * Its child nodes support property names with the following regex:
       *
       * /(.+)\.uritemplate/
       *    Indicate the value is a URITemplate. Context path is appended accordingly. It supports EL. The ``.uritemplate`` suffix is removed from the property name. Example::
       *
       *       + data
       *         - href.uritemplate = "/action.html{+item}"  // will produce {"href" : "/ctx/action.html{+item}"}
       *
       * /(.+)\.uritemplate.abs/
       *    Indicate the value is a URITemplate **that is resolved into an absolute path**. Context path will be appended. It supports EL. The ``.uritemplate.abs`` suffix is removed from the property name.
       *    This scenario is important when you use the variable at the first char of the URITemplate, thus this component cannot know if the variable is going to be resolved as a relative path or absolute path.
       *    Example::
       *
       *       + data
       *         - href.uritemplate.abs = "{+item}.html"  // will produce {"href" : "/ctx{+item}.html"}
       *
       * /(.+)\.url/
       *    Indicate the value is a URL. Context path is appended accordingly. It supports EL. The ``.url`` suffix is removed from the property name. Example::
       *
       *       + data
       *         - href.url = "/action.html"  // will produce {"href" : "/ctx/action.html"}
       *
       * /.+/
       *    No processing is done. The value is passed as is. Example::
       *

       *         - href = "/action.html"  // will produce {"href" : "/action.html"}
