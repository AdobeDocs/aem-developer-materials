==============

.. granite:servercomponent:: /libs/granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/admin/contentchecker

   ContentChecker is a component to check if a content is allowed to be managed by the admin.
   If the content is not allowed, 404 error is returned.

   It has the following content structure:

   .. gnd:gnd::

      [granite:AdminContentChecker]

      /**
       * The path of the resource to check.
       */
      - path (StringEL)

      /**
       * The complete path of the content to check (can contain selectors and extensions).
       * This property is only considered if ``path`` property is not set.
       */
      - urlPath (StringEL)

      /**
       * The regex to match the path; when not specified, the content is allowed.
       */
      - allowed (String) multiple

      /**
       * The regex to exclude the matching path which is matched by ``allowed`` property.
       *
       * So first the ``path`` is matched according to ``allowed`` reqex, then it is excluded by matching ``exclusion`` reqex.
       */
      - exclusion (String) multiple

      /**
       * ``true`` to allow if the path is ``null`` or empty string; ``false`` otherwise.
       */
      - allowEmpty (Boolean) = true

      /**
       * The URL to redirect to when the path is ``null`` or empty string.
       */
      - redirectWhenEmpty (StringEL)

   Example::

      + node1
        - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/admin/contentchecker"
        - path = "${requestPathInfo.suffix}"
        - allowEmpty = false
        - allowed = ["/content(?!.*?\b(catalogs|campaigns|dam|launches|mac|publications|usergenerated)\b).*"]
