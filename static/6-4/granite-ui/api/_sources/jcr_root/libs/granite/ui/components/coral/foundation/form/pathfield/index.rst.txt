PathField
=========

.. granite:servercomponent:: /libs/granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/form/pathfield
   :supertype: /libs/granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/form/field

   A field that allows the user to enter path.

   It extends :granite:servercomponent:`Field </libs/granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/form/field>` component.

   It supports the concept of suggestion where the list of options are presented based on what the user types.
   It also supports the concept of picker where the user allows to pick the value in more advanced way (usually implemented as a dialog showing a tree view).

   **Usage Guidelines**

   In Sling, a resource (thus a path) is a first class citizen. So naturally many things, such as WCM Pages, DAM Assets, Commerce Products are represented as paths.
   This field can then be used for that purpose. However, this field is only meant for general purpose pathfield, even though the suggestion and picker can be configured.
   It is recommended to create a dedicated field for each resource type accordingly.
   e.g. It is better to create a dedicated field for the purpose of selecting CQ Pages, with the applicable configuration configured OOTB.
   This is to allow convenient usage of the said field without forcing the author to know about URL, which can be an implementation detail.

   It has the following content structure:

   .. gnd:gnd::

      [granite:FormTextField] > granite:FormField

      /**
       * The name that identifies the field when submitting the form.
       */
