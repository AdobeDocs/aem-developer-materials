   Form is a component to represent a standard HTML form (<form>).

   It has the following content structure:

   .. gnd:gnd::

      [granite:Form] > granite:commonAttrs, granite:renderCondition

      /**
       * The action attribute.
       */
      - action (StringEL)

      /**
       * The enctype attribute.
       */
      - enctype (String)

      /**
       * The method attribute.
       */
      - method (String) < 'get', 'post'

      /**
       * The target attribute.
       */
      - target (String)

      /**
       * Indicates if input elements can by default have their values automatically completed by the browser.
       *
       * See also `MDN documentation regarding autocomplete attribute <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form>`_.
       */
      - autocomplete (String)

      /**
       * The ``novalidate`` attribute to indicate that the form is not to be validated when submitted.
       */
      - novalidate (Boolean)

      /**
       * The path to the resource to be used as the values by the contained form fields.
       *
       * The ValueMap of the resource is used as the key-value pairs that are matched by ``name`` property of the field.
       *
       * Given the following structure::
       *
       *    + /apps/example/myformvalues
       *      - name1 = "value1"
       *      - name2 = ["value1", "value2"]
       *
       *    + /apps/example/myform
       *      - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/form"
       *      - dataPath = "/apps/example/myformvalues"
       *      + items
       *        + textfield
       *          - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/form/textfield"
       *          - name = "name1"
       *
       * The textfield will be matched with ``name1`` key. The textfield will then use ``value1`` as its value.
       *
       * The value of the field ``name`` can be any string that can be passed to `ValueMap#get() <https://sling.apache.org/apidocs/sling8/org/apache/sling/api/resource/ValueMap.html#get-java.lang.String-java.lang.Class->`_.
       * So relative value works. e.g. ``name1``, ``./name1``, ``./childNode1/prop1``.
       *
       * The form is often used in conjunction with `SlingPostServlet <http://sling.apache.org/documentation/bundles/manipulating-content-the-slingpostservlet-servlets-post.html>`_
       * as the submission endpoint, where it defines a certain field name convention.
