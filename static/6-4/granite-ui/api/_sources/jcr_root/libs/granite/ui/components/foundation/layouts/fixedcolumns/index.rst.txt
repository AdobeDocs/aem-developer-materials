FixedColumns
============

.. granite:servercomponent:: /libs/granite/ui/components/foundation/layouts/fixedcolumns
   :layout:

   The layout to render each item as a column, which has a fixed width.
   This is mainly designed such that two columns fit a tablet device in landscape mode nicely.

   It has the following content structure at the layout resource:

   .. gnd:gnd::

      [granite:LayoutsFixedColumns]

      /**
       * ``true`` to add vertical margin to the main component; ``false`` otherwise.
       */
      - margin (Boolean) = 'true'

   The columns are specified using :ref:`ItemDataSource <ItemDataSource>`.

   Example::

      + mydialog
        - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/container"
        + layout
          - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/layouts/fixedcolumns"
        + items
          + column1
            - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/container"
          + column2
            - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/container"
