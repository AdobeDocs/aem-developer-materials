foundation-contentloaded event
==============================

This event SHOULD be triggered when a new content is injected to the DOM, which is very similar to `DOMContentLoaded <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/DOM_event_reference/DOMContentLoaded>`_ event. It is normally used so that a JavaScript code can be notified when new content needs to be enhanced (applying event handler, layout, etc).

The event SHOULD be triggered at the smallest containing element (the container) possible, which can be the injected element itself.

You can trigger it by using jQuery:

.. code-block:: js

   // in this example, document is the smallest container
   $(document).trigger("foundation-contentloaded");

When listening, the container is available at ``event.target``:

.. code-block:: js

   $(document).on("foundation-contentloaded", function(e) {
     var container = e.target;
   });
