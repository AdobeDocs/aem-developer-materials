Fragment
========

.. granite:servercomponent:: /libs/granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/page/fragment

   The component to wrap the page fragment.
   A fragment is a piece of content that is not part of the page and loaded separately.

   For example a page may contain a dialog that is only loaded when a certain button is activated.
   This dialog content is a fragment.

   This component is only used so that there is a root component for the fragment so that generic features can be implemented here.

   The features that it enables:

      * :doc:`Resource filtering using FilteringResourceWrapper </jcr_root/libs/granite/ui/docs/server/resourcehiding>` and acts as its container.

   It has the following content structure:

   .. gnd:gnd::

      [granite:PageFragment]

      /**
       * Indicates the actual content of the fragment.
       */
      + content mandatory

   **Example**

   Hide ``item2`` of the dialog using ``granite:hide`` property::

      + /mypage
        - sling:resourceType = "my/page"
        - dialogURL = "/mypage/dialog.html"
        + dialog
          - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/page/fragment"
          + content
            - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/dialog"
            - jcr:title = "My Dialog"
            + items
              + item1
                - sling:resourceType = "my/item"
              + item2
                - sling:resourceType = "my/item"
                - granite:hide = true
