   :layout:

   Mode layout is a layout that understands ``foundation-mode`` vocabulary.
   It is listening to ``foundation-mode-change`` event and will show the item having the same mode name as the event, while hiding the other items.
   The item mode name is indicated by its ``mode`` property, with fallback to ``item#getName()``.
   The group of the event will also be matched against the group set in the layout.

   It has the following content structure at the layout resource:

   .. gnd:gnd::

      [granite:LayoutsMode]

      /**
       * The mode that is active initially.
       *
       * Each item is matched against this mode, where it is set to active.
       * The item ``mode`` property (fallback to ``item#getName()``) is used to match with this mode.
       * If this property is not specified, the first item is active.
       */
      - mode (StringEL)

      /**
       * The group that this layout will be part of.
       */
      - group (String)

   The items of the layout are specified using :ref:`ItemDataSource <ItemDataSource>`.

   Example::

      + mymode
        - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/container"
        + layout
          - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/layouts/mode"
          - group = "myapp-mytopic-mygroup"
        + items
          + default
          + selection

   In above example, there are two modes configured: ``default`` and ``selection``.
   Since there is no ``mode`` specified at ``layout`` node, the first item (the default mode) is active.
   When ``foundation-mode-change`` is triggered with [mode = selection, group = myapp-mytopic-mygroup], the selection item will be shown and default item will be hidden.
