CycleButtons
============

.. granite:servercomponent:: /libs/granite/ui/components/foundation/cyclebuttons
   :deprecated:

   A component that show the current active item. Only one item can be active at the same time.
   When clicked, the next item of the active is shown and the click is triggered at that next item instead.
   If the last item is clicked, then the first item is shown and triggered accordingly.

   To indicate the active item, the following priorities are used:

   1. `active` property
   2. ``parentConfig/active`` boolean property at the item resource
   3. The first item

   It has the following content structure:

   .. gnd:gnd::

      [granite:CycleButtons] > granite:commonAttrs, granite:renderCondition

      /**
       * The name of the active item.
       */
      - active (StringEL)

      /**
       * The items of the component. Either specify this resource or `datasource` resource.
       */
      + items

      /**
       * The items of the component. Either specify this resource or `items` resource.
       */
      + datasource

   Example::

      + mybuttons
        - jcr:primaryType = "nt:unstructured"
        - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/cyclebuttons"
          + items
            + button1
              - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/button"
              - text = "Button1"
            + button2
              - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/button"
              - text = "Button2"
              + parentConfig
                - active = true
