**********************************
Migration Guide to CoralUI 3-based
**********************************

New Location
============

#. A new set of Sling components of Granite UI Foundation is created for Coral3 under :doc:`/libs/granite/ui/components/coral/foundation </jcr_root/libs/granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/server>`
#. A new clientlib of Granite UI Foundation, named :doc:`granite.ui.coral.foundation </jcr_root/libs/granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/clientlibs/foundation/index>` is also created
#. So basically there is one set for CoralUI 2-based components and one set for CoralUI 3-based components
#. The new set will not be just a copy-paste of the old set, rather it will be cleaned up (e.g. streamlining, removing deprecated feature)
#. It is recommended that a page only use either CoralUI 3-based or CoralUI 2-based set (i.e. not mixed)


Layout Concept
==============

The new set will not use the :doc:`layout concept </jcr_root/libs/granite/ui/docs/server/layout>` anymore.
This is to increase the simplicity of the understanding of Granite UI.
Each layout component thus becomes a standard component.

The layout mechanic itself is still there for other to use if needed.

Before::

   + mytabs
     - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/container"
     + layout
       - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/layouts/tabs"
     + items
       + tab1
         - jcr:title = "Tab 1"
         - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/container"
       + tab2
         - jcr:title = "Tab 2"
         - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/foundation/container"
         + layoutConfig
           - active = true

After::

   + mytabs
     - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/tabs"
     + items
       + tab1
         - jcr:title = "Tab 1"
         - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/container"
       + tab2
         - jcr:title = "Tab 2"
         - sling:resourceType = "granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/container"
         + parentConfig
           - active = true


Streamlining the API
====================

Since we have to create a new set of RT and clientlib, we have an opportunity to revisit the API.

#. The :doc:`common attributes </jcr_root/libs/granite/ui/docs/server/commonattrs>`, such as ``granite:class`` are strictly implemented to replace existing properties, such as ``class``.
#. Unnecessary or similar component is removed.
#. :doc:`/jcr_root/libs/granite/ui/components/coral/foundation/clientlibs/foundation/js/validation/index` in the client-side replaces $.validator (deprecated).


Component Mapping
=================

If not specify, by default the equivalence of an existing component can be found at the same relative path to /libs/granite/ui/components/coral/foundation.


Removed Components
------------------

The following is the list of components that are removed in the new set.
