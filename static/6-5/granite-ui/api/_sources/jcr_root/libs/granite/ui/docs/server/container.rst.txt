Container Component
===================

A container component acts as a container for items. It follows :ref:`ItemDataSource <ItemDataSource>` mechanic.

It has the following content structure:

.. gnd:gnd::

   [granite:container]

   /**
    * Indicates the items of the container literally.
    *
    * Either this resource or ``datasource`` resource is needed.
    */
   + items

   /**
    * Indicates the items of the container dynamically using DataSource.
    *
    * Either this resource or ``items`` resource is needed.
    */
   + datasource
