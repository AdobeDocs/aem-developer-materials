This namespace is available to the user during scripting. The namespace provides some utility APIs that can be used in the scripts Since: 6.0 Methods &lt;static&gt; sum(panels, fieldName) sum up a set of fields inside a set of panels. Sums up all the fields having the name fieldName in a set of panels Note: If an element inside the panels Array is not an adaptive form Panel or field referred by fieldName in a panel is not a Numeric Field, it will not be considered. Parameters: Name Type Description panels Array.&lt;Panel&gt; array of Panel objects fieldName string name of the numericField Since: 6.0 Returns: sum of the value of the fields Type number Example returns the sum of all fields named nf5 inside all the instances of panel p4 af.sum(p4.instanceManager.instances,'nf5') &lt;static&gt; avg(panels, fieldName) averages up the values of multiple Numeric Fields The API looks for all the Numeric Fields having the name fieldName inside the list of panels The API is most useful to calculate the average of a Numeric Field inside a repeatable table row. Note: If an element inside the panels array is not a Panel or fieldName inside the panel is not a Numeric Field, it will not be considered. For the purpose of calculations null values are treated as 0 Parameters: Name Type Description panels Array.&lt;Panel&gt; array of Panel objects fieldName string name of the numericField inside the panels array to consider for calculating the average Since: 6.0 Returns: average of the value of the considered fields inside the panels array Type number Example returns the average of all fields named nf5 inside all the instances of panel p4 af.avg(p4.instanceManager.instances,'nf5') &lt;static&gt; max(panels, fieldName) find the maximum value field among a set of fields Finds the field having the maximum value amongst the set of fields with the name fieldName in a set of panels. Note: If an element inside the panels Array is not an adaptive form Panel or field referred by fieldName in a panel is not a Numeric Field, it will not be considered. For the purpose of calculations null values are treated as 0 Parameters: Name Type Description panels Array.&lt;Panel&gt; array of Panel objects fieldName string name of the numericField to consider Since: 6.0 Returns: The Field having the maximum value among a set of fields Type Field Example returns the field having the maximum value among all fields that are named nf5 inside all the instances of panel p4 af.max(p4.instanceManager.instances,'nf5') &lt;static&gt; min(panels, fieldName) find the minimum value field among a set of fields Finds the field having the minimum value amongst the set of fields with the name fieldName in a set of panels. Note: If an element inside the panels Array is not an Adaptive Form Panel or field referred by fieldName in the panel is not a Numeric Field, it will not be considered. For the purpose of calculations null values are treated as 0 Parameters: Name Type Description panels Array.&lt;Panel&gt; array of adaptive forms Panel objects fieldName string name of the numericField Since: 6.0 Returns: the field having the minimum value Type Field Example returns the field having the minimum value among all fields that are named nf5 inside all the instances of panel p4 af.min(p4.instanceManager.instances,'nf5') &lt;static&gt; reduce(panels, fieldName, iterator, memo [, context]) boils down a values of multiple fields into a single value. Value of fields, having the name fieldName in the panels array, are combined into a single value as per the iterator function. memo is the initial state of the reduction, and at each successive step it should be returned by iterator. A list of Fields is identied by looking for Field having the name fieldName inside each Panel in the panels array. Then the iterator function is called for each of the Fields The iterator is called as many times as the length of the fields list, and is passed three arguments: memo, for first iteration it is the value passed and for successive iterations the value returned by iterator in the previous iteration. Panel object, Parent Panel of the Field object Field object, Field from the list of fields having the index equal to the iteration number Parameters: Name Type Argument Description panels Array.&lt;Panel&gt; Array containing the Panel objects fieldName string Name of the field to look in the panels array provided in the first argument iterator af~ReduceIterator function which will be called for each Field object memo * initial state of reduction context object &lt;optional&gt; this param in the iterator will point to this object. Since: 6.0 See: _.reduce() Returns: boiled down value by applying iterator recursively on each field Type * &lt;static&gt; filter(panels, fieldName, predicate [, context]) Filters a list of fields based on the predicate Looks through each Field having the name fieldName in the panels array, call predicate function on them iteratively and returns those fields for which predicate function returns true The arguments to the predicate will be Panel object and Field object. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description panels Array.&lt;Panel&gt; Array containing the Panel objects fieldName string Name of the field to look in the array of Panel objects provided as the first argument predicate af~filterPredicate function to execute for each field context object &lt;optional&gt; this in the predicate function will point to this object Since: 6.0 Returns: list of fields for which the predicate function returned true Type Array.&lt;Field&gt; &lt;static&gt; formatDateToISOString(dateObject) formats date object into ISO String i.e. in yyyy-mm-dd format. Accepts a date object and passes back date in yyyy-mm-dd format which is accepted by adaptive forms Parameters: Name Type Description dateObject Date object Since: 6.0 Returns: converts dateObject in YYYY-MM-DD format Type string Example To set today's date in Date Field var today = new Date(); datefield.value = af.formatDateToISOString(today) Type Definitions ReduceIterator(memo, panel, field) iterator function for the af.reduce function Parameters: Name Type Description memo * initial value passed to the reduce function panel Panel Panel element field Field Field element See: af#reduce Returns: the value to be used as memo in the next iteration Type * filterPredicate(panel, field) predicate function for the af#filter function Parameters: Name Type Description panel Panel Panel element field Field Field element See: af#filter Returns: value of the predicate test.

In Adaptive Form Fields can have three types of validations Mandatory (Field is required) Pattern Validation (value entered must match a pattern) Script Validation (custom scripts that return a boolean value) This API executes all three types of validation in this order and if any of it fails, it returns false. If all the three pass, then it returns true. The failure rules for these validations are defined as Mandatory validations fail if the Field is mandatory and its value is null. Script Validations fail if a validate Expression is defined and the return value of the expression is not true.

In Adaptive Form Fields can have three types of validations Mandatory (Field is required) Pattern Validation (value entered must match a pattern) Script Validation (custom scripts that return a boolean value) This API executes all three types of validation in this order and if any of it fails, it returns false. If all the three pass, then it returns true. The failure rules for these validations are defined as Mandatory validations fail if the Field is mandatory and its value is null. Script Validations fail if a validate Expression is defined and the return value of the expression is not true. Pattern Validations fail if the field has a validate Pattern and value entered doesn't match that pattern. These validations are run automatically in the following two cases when the value of this field is changed or user submits the Form Parameters: Name Type Description errorList Array.&lt;Field~ValidationError&gt; The array will be filled with the ValidationError object if the validations on the field fail.

Script Validations fail if a validate Expression is defined and the return value of the expression is not true. Pattern Validations fail if the field has a validate Pattern and value entered doesn't match that pattern.

In Adaptive Form Fields can have three types of validations Mandatory (Field is required) Pattern Validation (value entered must match a pattern) Script Validation (custom scripts that return a boolean value) This API executes all three types of validation in this order and if any of it fails, it returns false. If all the three pass, then it returns true. The failure rules for these validations are defined as Mandatory validations fail if the Field is mandatory and its value is null. Script Validations fail if a validate Expression is defined and the return value of the expression is not true. Pattern Validations fail if the field has a validate Pattern and value entered doesn't match that pattern. These validations are run automatically in the following two cases when the value of this field is changed or user submits the Form Parameters: Name Type Description errorList Array.&lt;Field~ValidationError&gt; The array will be filled with the ValidationError object if the validations on the field fail.

Type: boolean Since: 6.0 &lt;readonly&gt; data :* data returned by GuideBridge API The type of the data is specific to the API and documentation of that API provides more details about the data Type: * Since: 6.0 Methods getNextMessage() Returns the error message thrown by the GuideBridge API. When a GuideBridge API fails, it throws an error message. This is indicated by the errors property. To get the errors, one has to call this API. The API can throw multiple errors and the user has to call this API until it returns null indicating no more errors. Since: 6.0 Returns: object containing the error message Type GuideResultObject~ErrorMessage Type Definitions ErrorMessage Error Message returned by GuideBridge API Type: object Properties: Name Type Argument Description code number Error Code somExpression string &lt;nullable&gt; Som Expression of the GuideNode the error is related to.

Some of the use cases for using this API Submit Adaptive Form from a custom button present outside the Form. Get current Adaptive Form state and save it in local storage for restoring it later on. Plugging in custom widgets. Manipulate the Adaptive Form component properties, like value, visibility from outside the Form Listen to bridge events and send data to Analytics server for reporting Accessing the Instance of GuideBridgeTo access the GuideBridge APIs, one needs to get hold of an instance of GuideBridge. The object is available on the window after the GuideBridge script is loaded. One can directly access it by using window.guideBridge. But that requires the user script is written after the GuideBridge script is loaded. In certain cases, a user might not be aware of when their script gets loaded, in those cases the recommended approach is to listen to the bridgeInitializeStart event which provides an instance of GuideBridge object. window.addEventListener(\"bridgeInitializeStart\", function(evnt) { // get hold of the guideBridge object var gb = evnt.detail.guideBridge; })Or, if you are sure that your script will execute after GuideBridge Script is loaded, then you can directly use window.guideBridge. In cases like your script is present at the bottom of the page or you are executing on jquery dom ready event. $(function () { // one can directly access guideBridge object here. window.guideBridge.connect(function () { //call guideBridge APIs }) }) Wait for Form to get readyAfter getting the GuideBridge object one needs to wait for the Form to get initialized. This can be done by providing a callback to the connect API guideBridge.connect(function (){ //this callback will be called after adaptive form is initialized // do your custom processing })Note: There is no link between Dom ready events and the connect API. If one wants to access the HTML DOM from inside the connect callback, the recommended approach is to listen on the jQuery ready event or the native DOMContentLoaded event. Similarly if one wants to access GuideBridge APIs one needs to wait for the connect callback to get fired. Using the GuideBridge APIAPIs are provided for external applications to connect with Adaptive Form and FormDom. The APIs can be loosely divided into two categories, synchronous and asynchronous. The synchronous getter API returns a GuideResultObject which represents the result of the API whereas each setter API throws an exception in case of error(s) and it is the responsibility of the API to catch those exceptions. The GuideResultObject either contains error or the return value of the API and provides easy mechanism to access each of them. var result = guideBridge.hideGlobalToolbar() if (result.errors) { console.error(\"Unable to hide toolbar\"); var msg = guideResultObject.getNextMessage(); while (msg != null) { console.error(msg.message); msg = guideResultObject.getNextMessage(); } } else { console.log(\"toolbar hidden successfully\"); }Each asynchronous API provides callback mechanism to return the result of the API. Each API takes a Javascript Object having success and error handlers. The success and error handlers receive GuideResultObject as input. In the success callback, the arguments data property is set to the return value of the API, while in the error callback the errors property is set to true. Some APIs might need extra input and that will be defined by the API guideBridge.getData({ success : function (guideResultObject) { console.log(\"data received\" + guideResultObject.data); } error : function (guideResultObject) { console.error(\"API Failed\"); var msg = guideResultObject.getNextMessage(); while (msg != null) { console.error(msg.message); msg = guideResultObject.getNextMessage(); } } });Note: Some APIs do not follow the above norm and it is mentioned in the documentation of that API GuideBridge EventsGuideBridge API triggers a set of events to notify the current action a user has taken. Developers can listen on that event using the on API and perform some tasks. For example a developer can listen on elementFocusChanged and capture for how long a user spends time on that field. All the events triggered by GuideBridge are mentioned below. GuideBridge provides an event object which contains extra information about the event. For example elementFocusChanged event provides information about the previous field that was in focus and the current field that came to focus. The on API takes a GuideBridgeEventCallback as input. The callback is passed two arguments, event and payload where the extra information is passed in the payload argument. The documentation of each event lists the values of different properties of the payload object. guideBridge.on(eventName, function (event, payload) { // access payload properties ... }) Since: 6.0 Methods isConnected() Whether the Adaptive Form has been initialized or not All GuideBridge APIs (except connect) require Adaptive Form to be initialized. Checking the return value of this API is not necessary if guideBridge API is called only after the Form is initialized Since: 6.0 Returns: true if the Adaptive Form is ready for interaction, false otherwise Type boolean connect(handler [, context]) Register a callback to be executed when the Adaptive Form gets initialized Specify a callback function which is called/notified when Adaptive Form gets initialized. After Adaptive Form is initialized GuideBridge is ready for interaction and one can call any API. The callback can also be registered after the Form gets initialized. In that case, the callback will be called immediately. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description handler function function that would be called when guideBridge is ready for interaction. The signature of the callback should be function() { // app specific code here } context object &lt;optional&gt; this object in the callback function will point to context Since: 6.0 Example guideBridge.connect(function() { console.log(\"Hurrah! Guide Bridge Activated\"); }) getBridgeVersion() returns the version of GuideBridge library Since: 6.0 Returns: the version of the GuideBridge library Type string registerConfig(key [, config]) Registers user/portal specific configurations to GuideBridge Adaptive Form uses some default named configurations to provide its default behaviour. This configurations can be modified by providing a new configuration. The API accepts the name of the configuration and updated configuration. Based on value of the new configuration the behaviour of the Form gets changed. Currently supported configurations are: postExternalMessageConfigDeprecated : since 6.2 this configuration is deprecated. Use the GuideBridge.events:bridgeInitializeStart event to do the same handling In case Adaptive Form is embedded inside an iframe, this configuration allows developers to provide GuideBridge Instance to parent or child windows. By default, GuideBridge instance is only available to the current window and to the parent window if it doesn't violate the cross-origin policy. Now there may be a case when this doesn't solves the problem, then one can take advantage of this configuration to extend this functionality. For the signature of the configuration see postExternalMessageConfig ExampleTo provide the GuideBridge instance to a child window window.on(\"bridgeInitializeStart\", function (evnt) { var gb = evnt.detail.guideBridge; gb.registerConfig(\"postExternalMessageConfig\", { \"postExternalHandler\" : function(data) { // assume we have a child window with an id 'childWindowId' var childWindow = document.getElementById(\"#childWindowId\").contentWindow; var tmpEvent = document.createEvent(\"CustomEvent\"); tmpEvent.initCustomEvent(data.name, true, true, data.data); childWindow.dispatchEvent(tmpEvent); } }); });widgetConfigThe configuration is used to modify the appearance of a specific Field. Adaptive Form allows developers to create custom widgets and use them in their Forms. The signature of the config is { \"&lt;component-identifier&gt; : \"&lt;widget-name&gt;\"}where &lt;component-identifier&gt; can be either the name or classname of Adaptive Form Field, while widget name is the name of the jQuery Widget. submitConfigTo modify the default submit behaviour one can provide this configuration. The signature of the config is defined below guideBridge.registerConfig(\"submitConfig\", {\"useAjax\" : true}); Parameters: Name Type Argument Description key string configuration name. one of the following postExternalMessageConfig widgetConfig submitConfig config widgetConfig | GuideBridge~submitConfig | GuideBridge~postExternalMessageConfig &lt;optional&gt; configuration object for the configuration Since: 6.0 Returns: GuideResultObject with data having the old configuration against the same key Type GuideResultObject setProperty(somList, propertyName, valueList) Modify a property for a set of Nodes Sets the value of a property for a set of GuideNode to a different value.

Invalid SomExpressions and the corresponding value in the valueList are ignored. propertyName string name of the property which has to be modified valueList Array.&lt;*&gt; an array containing value of the propertyName for each element in somList Since: 6.0 See: GuideNode#somExpression Examples Modifying the value of a set of fields guideBridge.setProperty([\"SOM_OF_FIELD_1\", \"SOM_OF_FIELD_2\"...... \"SOM_OF_FIELD_N\"] \"value\" [VALUE_1, VALUE_2 .... VALUE_N]); Hiding a single field guideBridge.setProperty([\"SOM_OF_FIELD_1\"] \"visibility\" [false]); getDataXML(options, options) Return Form data as XML. Used to retrieve the Form data as XML. The API gets the data xml synchronously/asynchronously based on the async option and invokes the success/error handlers passed in the arguments upon completion.

Parameters: Name Type Description options object input to the getDataXML API Properties Name Type Argument Default Description success function &lt;optional&gt; callback which receives the result of the API in case of success. error function &lt;optional&gt; callback which receives the result of the API in case of failure. errors property as true. context object &lt;optional&gt; this object inside the success and error callback will point to this object async boolean &lt;optional&gt; true whether to make the server call asynchronously or not. If false, the browser will wait for the server to return the XML and then execute the success or error callbacks object options Since: 6.0 Deprecated: since 6.3 this API is deprecated. Use getData API instead. See: GuideBridge API Usage Example guideBridge.getDataXML({ success : function (guideResultObject) { console.log(\"xml data received\" + guideResultObject.data); } error : function (guideResultObject) { console.error(\"API Failed\"); var msg = guideResultObject.getNextMessage(); while (msg != null) { console.error(msg.message); msg = guideResultObject.getNextMessage(); } } }); getData(options) Return Form data as XML or JSON depending on the Schema Type. Used to retrieve the Form data as XML or JSON depending on the Schema Type. Only for JSON Schema based Forms and Form Data Model based forms, the data will be in JSON format while for others, the data will be in XML format. The API gets the data synchronously/asynchronously based on the async option and invokes the success/error handlers passed in the arguments upon completion. In the success callback the data parameter contains the data string. The success and error handlers receive GuideResultObject as input. Parameters: Name Type Description options object input to the getData API Properties Name Type Argument Default Description success function &lt;optional&gt; callback which receives the result of the API in case of success. error function &lt;optional&gt; callback which receives the result of the API in case of failure. errors property as true. context object &lt;optional&gt; this object inside the success and error callback will point to this object async boolean &lt;optional&gt; true whether to make the server call asynchronously or not.

The API is a asynchronous API and takes success handler which is called with the list of File Names and URLs. Parameters: Name Type Description options object Object containing the callback which will be invoked with the result of this API Properties Name Type Argument Description success function success callback which will be invoked. The signature of the callback should match the signature of FileAttachmentInfoHandler context object &lt;optional&gt; this parameter in the success handler will point to this object Since: 6.0 Example Example usage of the getFileAttachmentsInfo API guideBridge.getFileAttachmentsInfo({ success:function(list) { for(var i = 0; i&lt; list.length; i++) { console.log(list[i].name + \" \"+ list[i].path); } } }); visit(callback [, context]) Traverse all the components in the Adaptive Form and invoke callback function for each of the component Iterates over all the components in the Adaptive Form and invokes its visit method passing the callback to the API. Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description callback function Function to be called for every Adaptive Form Component present in the Form. The signature of the callback matches the signature of VisitorCallback context object &lt;optional&gt; window this object in the callback will point to this object Since: 6.0 Example Creating a list of all components having name testName var myList = [] guideBridge.visit(function(cmp) { if(cmp.name === \"testName\") { myList.push[cmp]; } }}; hideSummaryPanel() Hides the panel that contains the summary component. In Adaptive Form there is a summary component to show the summary of submission. This API hides the parent panel of the summary component. If the component is not present inside the Form, this operation doesn't do anything Since: 6.0 Returns: the data property of GuideResultObject would be undefined. The API will fail if the Form is not initialized which would be indicated by the GuideResultObject#errors property. Type GuideResultObject getGuideState(options) Retrieve the current state of Adaptive Form as json string Adaptive Form stores its state in the form of JSON. The Files attached in the component are uploaded onto the server and their paths are returned in the JSON state except in certain conditions mentioned below. The API is an asynchronous call which calls the success and error handlers with the data. In the below mentioned scenarios the file will not be uploaded User doesn't have write permissions on the fileUploadPath provided The fileUploadPath property doesn't point to a node of type sling:Folder Parameters: Name Type Description options object Input object containing the callbacks that will be invoked to provide the result of the API Properties Name Type Argument Description success function &lt;optional&gt; callback which receives the result of the API in case of success. errors property as false. error function &lt;optional&gt; callback which receives the result of the API in case of failure. errors property as true. context object &lt;optional&gt; this object inside the success and error callback will point to this object fileUploadPath string &lt;optional&gt; controls whether the files in the File Attachment component have to be uploaded or not. If fileUploadPath is non null, only then file gets uploaded and the model's value is updated with the file url Since: 6.0 validate(errorList [, somExpression] [, setFocus]) validate the entire Form or a component in Adaptive Form Validates the Adaptive Form or it's specific panel and return the validation status. The API also moves focus to first invalid element Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description errorList Array.&lt;Field~ValidationError&gt; Input must be an empty array. The array will be filled with list of Adaptive Form Components that failed validation. somExpression string &lt;optional&gt; SOM Expression of the Guide Node for which validation should be triggered. If not provided, it would validate the entire Adaptive Form setFocus boolean &lt;optional&gt; true If true, set focus to the first invalid element. Since: 6.0 See: Field#validate Panel#validate Returns: true if the component/form was valid, false otherwise Type boolean restoreGuideState(options) restore/prepopulate the state of Adaptive Form from an earlier saved state Adaptive Form can be restore in three ways by passing the JSON data obtained from GuideBridge#getGuideState. This can be done by setting data property . by passing a URL pointing to a resource that returns JSON/XML data that should be used. This can be done by setting dataRef property. The data can be obtained by calling the getData API. by passing a URL pointing to a resource that returns JSON data obtained from GuideBridge#getGuideState. This can be done by setting guideStatePathRef property . When restoring from dataRef, only values and other properties, that are dependant on value, are restored. For example, If a Field was hidden based on the click of a Button then when restoring from data XML/JSON the Field will not remain hidden. NOTE: The data, dataRef and guideStatePathRef must not be null simultaneously and only one property must be specified. Specifying more than one can lead to undesired results. Parameters: Name Type Description options object object containing the callbacks to be invoked on success/failure and data from where to restore the object. Properties Name Type Argument Description success function &lt;optional&gt; callback which receives the result of the API in case of success errors property as false. error function &lt;optional&gt; callback which receives the result of the API in case of failure. errors property as true. context object &lt;optional&gt; this object inside the success and error callback will point to this object. data object &lt;optional&gt; It must be the value of the data property passed to the success handler of getGuideState API. dataRef string &lt;optional&gt; URL pointing to the data XML/JSON. guideStatePathRef string &lt;optional&gt; URL pointing to the JSON state of Adaptive Form. Since: 6.0 Examples Restoring from JSON data var jsonData; guideBridge.getGuideState({ success : function (guideResultObj) { jsonData = guideResultObj.data; }, error : function (guideResultObj) { // log error } }); // after some time or on click of a button or reloading the page guideBridge.restoreGuideState({ guideState : jsonData.guideState, error : function (guideResultObject) { // log the errors } }) Restoring from data XML/JSON guideBridge.getData({ success : function (guideResultObj) { var data = guideResultObj.data; //post the data to a server that saves it at say http://abc.com/my/data.xml //or http://abc.com/my/data.json }, error : function (guideResultObj) { // log the errors } }); // after some time or on click of a button or reloading the page guideBridge.restoreGuideState({ dataRef : \"http://abc.com/my/data.xml\", error : function (guideResultObject) { // log the errors } }) Restoring from URL to a JSON guideBridge.getGuideState({ success : function (guideResultObj) { var json = guideResultObj.data; //post the JSON to a server that saves it at say http://abc.com/my/data.json }, error : function (guideResultObj) { // log the errors } }); // after some time or on click of a button or reloading the page guideBridge.restoreGuideState({ guideStatePathRef : \"http://abc.com/my/data.json\", error : function (guideResultObject) { // log the errors } }) resolveNode(somExpression) Given a somExpression, return the GuideNode having the same somExpression. Parameters: Name Type Description somExpression string somExpression of the Adaptive Form component Since: 6.0 See: GuideNode#somExpression Returns: GuideNode matching the som expression or null if not found Type GuideNode reset() Reset the values of all the Fields to their default values. Invokes Field#resetData API for all the Fields inside the Form to reset their values to default Since: 6.0 getFocus(options) return the somExpression of the Panel or Field that is currently in focus Returns the somExpression of the current Panel or current Field in Focus. The API can also be used to get the somExpression of the Navigable Panel that contains the current Element in Focus. Parameters: Name Type Description options object configuration to be passed to the API to get the desired result Properties Name Type Argument Description focusOption string &lt;optional&gt; &lt;nullable&gt; Currently the following value of this option are supported navigablePanel: if one wants to get the somExpression of the Navigable Panel Since: 6.0 See: {GuideNode#somExpression} Returns: somExpression of Adaptive Form component representing the field or panel. Type string Example guideBridge.getFocus({\"focusOption\": \"navigablePanel\"}) setFocus(somExpression [, focusOption] [, runCompletionScript]) Sets focus to a Field or Panel In Adaptive Form one can focus a Field/Panel. Setting focus on a Panel means setting focus to its first child. This can be controlled using the focusOption provided in this API. The API provides two mechanism to focus a Field/Panel. Direct : By providing the somExpression of the Field/Panel. If the somExpression of Panel is provided, then based on the focusOption one of its child (or their child) is set to Focus Indirect : By providing an item's relative position inside a Panel, first or last item inside of a Panel, sibling of current focussed Item of a Panel, etc. If the item is a Panel then the First Item of that Panel (if that is again a Panel, this process continues until a Field is found) is activated. The first way is trivial, by providing the somExpression of a Field to the API, the focus will be set to the Field. If that Field is inside a Panel that is not currently open because of tabbed/wizard navigation, then that tab would be opened and focus would be set to the Field/Panel. The API can also execute the completion expression of the current Panel and only if the expression returns true set focus to the required element. Note: If focusOption is either of nextItemDeep or prevItemDeep then somExpression parameter must not be passed. Otherwise the API will throw an exception If somExpression points to a Field and focusOption is not nextItemDeep or prevItemDeep then focusOption is ignored. Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description somExpression string &lt;nullable&gt; SOM Expression of the Adaptive Form Field or Panel which has to be activated. focusOption string &lt;optional&gt; firstItem The option provides the mechanism to focus onto an sibling of the current active item. firstItem - Focuses to the first focusable item of the Panel whose SOM Expression is provided lastItem - Focuses to the last focusable item of the Panel whose SOM Expression is provided If either the firstItem or lastItem is a Panel, then the firstItem of that Panel (until a Field is found) is set to Focus. nextItem - Next sibling component of the current active Item of the Panel whose somExpression is provided. It is equivalent to the result of panel.navigationContext.nextItem API. prevItem - Previous sibling component of the current active Item of the Panel show somExpression is provided. It is equivalent to the result of panel.navigationContext.prevItem API. nextItemDeep - Focus is set to the next Navigable Panel of root Panel in DFS Order prevItemDeep - Focus is set to the next Navigable Panel of root Panel in DFS Order runCompletionScript boolean &lt;optional&gt; false indicating whether to execute the completion expression or not. Since: 6.0 Returns: true if the focus was set to requested field successfully otherwise false Type boolean Example setFocus(somExpression); // Focus is set to the specified somExpression. setFocus(this.panel.somExpression,'nextItem',true); // Focus is set to next item in the Panel. setFocus(null,'nextItemDeep',true); // Focus is set to next navigable Panel in rootPanel submit(options) submits the Adaptive Form Validate and submits the data of the Adaptive Form to the pre-configured submit action. The success handler provided in the argument is executed only if the Adaptive Form is configured to use AJAX for submission using registerConfig API Parameters: Name Type Description options object options to control the behaviour of submit API. Properties Name Type Argument Default Description submissionSelector string &lt;optional&gt; url selector governs the submission behaviour at server Default value is \"submit\", other options are \"agreement\", \"signSubmit\" success function &lt;optional&gt; callback which receives the result of the API in case of success. errors property as false. error function &lt;optional&gt; callback which receives the result of the API in case of failure. errors property as true. context object &lt;optional&gt; this object inside the success and error callback will point to this object validate boolean &lt;optional&gt; true whether to validate the form before submission or not Since: 6.0 Examples Submitting the form without validation guideBridge.submit({ validate: false, error : function (guideResultObject) {//log message} }); Submitting the form and showing a success message guideBridge.registerConfig(\"submitConfig\" : {\"useAjax\" : true}); guideBridge.submit({ validate: false, error : function (guideResultObject) {//log message} success : function (guideResultObject) {alert(\"data submitted successfully\") }); handleServerValidationError(errorJson) Displays validation error messages at field level This API displays validation error messages at the field level corresponding to the input errorJson object Parameters: Name Type Description errorJson object json object containing the error messages in the standard format See: validation message in adaptive form on(eventName, handler [, context]) add a listener on a GuideBridge Event. The API can be used to add an event listener for events triggered by GuideBridge object Parameters: Name Type Argument Description eventName string name of the event for which listener has to be added. It must be one of the following events bridgeInitializeComplete elementEnableChanged elementFocusChanged elementHelpShown elementLazyLoaded elementNavigationChanged elementValidationStatusChanged elementValueChanged elementVisibleChanged: guideAutoSaveStart submitStart validationComplete handler function callback to be invoked whenever the event is triggered. The signature of the callback is GuideBridgeEventCallback context object &lt;optional&gt; The this object in the handler will point to context Since: 6.0 off(eventName [, selector] [, handler]) Unregister the event registered using the on function Parameters: Name Type Argument Description eventName string name of the event to un-register. selector string &lt;optional&gt; selector which should match the one originally passed to guideBridge's on() while registering handlers handler function &lt;optional&gt; handler which needs to un-registered. If not provided all the event listeners will be unregistered Since: 6.0 getAutoSaveEnabledStatus() Whether autoSave is enabled for this Adaptive Form or not Adaptive Form can be configured to save draft automatically. This property indicates whether Adaptive Form is configured to save draft automatically or not. Enabling auto save doesn't mean that AF will create the draft when the Form is loaded. Based on the result of Auto save start expression the draft will be created. Once the expression returns true, drafts will be saved at regular interval or at specific events as configured. Since: 6.1 FP1 See: Saving an adaptive Form Returns: true if auto save is enabled otherwise false. Type boolean hasAutoSaveStarted() Whether Adaptive Form data is being saved as draft or not. This API indicates that auto save is enabled and draft is being saved at the configured location. Since: 6.1 FP1 See: Saving an adaptive Form Returns: whether autoSave has started. Type Boolean getAutoSaveInfo() the autoSaveinfo that is stored at the guideContainer. Since: 6.1 FP1 Deprecated: since 6.3 Returns: object contains the additional meta information stored along with form data Type object afSubmissionInfo(property [, value]) store or retrieve submission related information The API is used to provide extra information to be saved in Final data XML. It can also be used to retrieve that information. If value is null then the value of the property is returned Parameters: Name Type Argument Description property string name of the property against which to save the value or retrieve the value of property value string &lt;optional&gt; value to save. Since: 6.1 FP1 Deprecated: since 6.3 Returns: old value of the property Type * getSubmissionMetadataInfo() this API returns the metadata configured for submission. Value depends on the selection of metadata type, local or global. Since: 6.1 FP1 Deprecated: since 6.3 Returns: Type Object getComputedSubmissionMetadata() returns the globalMetaInfo object after all the computation. This object will be set in guideContext for submission Since: 6.1 FP1 Deprecated: since 6.3 Returns: In a format {\"key 1\": computation result of registered expression, \"key 2\":...} Type object Example { \"key 1\": computation result of registered expression, ... } setEnabledAutoSave(value) enable auto save in Adaptive Form. The API enables auto save in Adaptive Form Parameters: Name Type Description value boolean true to enable auto save otherwise false. Since: 6.1 FP1 See: getAutoSaveEnabledStatus Auto Save an Adaptive Form setFocus(options) An alternate signature to the setFocus API The API is equivalent to calling guideBridge.setFocus(options.somExpression, options.focusOption, options.runCompletionScript) Parameters: Name Type Description options object options passed to the API Properties Name Type Description somExpression string somExpression to set the focus to focusOption string item inside the Panel to focus to runCompletionScript string whether to run the completion script or not. Since: 6.1 FP1 Returns: true if the focus was set successfully otherwise false. Type boolean loadAdaptiveForm(options) load an Adaptive Form given its path This API returns the HTML content of another Adaptive Form and optionally load the Form inside an HTML element The data property of the result passed to success handler will contain the HTML of the Form Parameters: Name Type Description options object object to pass to the API Properties Name Type Argument Description success function &lt;optional&gt; callback which receives the result of the API in case of success. errors property as false. error function &lt;optional&gt; callback which receives the result of the API in case of failure. errors property as true. context object &lt;optional&gt; this object inside the success and error callback will point to this object path string Path of the Adaptive Form whose HTML is required. If sever is running at a context path, this parameter must have the context path dataRef string &lt;optional&gt; URL of the resource that returns the XML. The protocol of the URL must match the supported URL protocols containerSelector string &lt;optional&gt; jquery Selector of the HTML element where to insert the HTML of the form. Since: 6.1 FP1 See: jQuery selectors GuideBridge API Usage Example guideBridge.loadAdaptiveForm({ success : function (guideResultObj) {console.log(\"html is \" + guideResultObj.data)}, error : function (guideResultObj) { //log errors}, dataRef : \"http://url/of/the/dataRef\", path : \"/contextpath/content/dam/formsanddocuments/form1\" }) unloadAdaptiveForm(containerSelector) Unloads an adaptive Form from the browser, removing all the existing event listeners, data, html. Unloads the Form loaded using the loadAdaptiveForm API Parameters: Name Type Description containerSelector jQuery Selector of the container, which contains the HTML of the Adaptive Form Since: 6.1 FP1 See: jQuery selectors hideResetButtons() Hides all the reset buttons present in the Adaptive Form Since: 6.3 Returns: the data property of GuideResultObject would be undefined. The API will fail if the Form is not initialized which would be indicated by the GuideResultObject#errors property. Type GuideResultObject setData(options) Populate the Adaptive Form from the data. Adaptive Form can set data in three ways: by passing the JSON data obtained from GuideBridge#getGuideState. This can be done by setting data property . by passing a URL pointing to a resource that returns data JSON/XML that should be used. This can be done by setting dataRef property. The data can be obtained by calling the getData API. by passing a URL pointing to a resource that returns JSON data obtained from GuideBridge#getGuideState. This can be done by setting guideStatePathRef property . When setting data from dataRef, only values and other properties, that are dependant on value, are set. For example, If a Field was hidden based on the click of a Button in the data passed then when setting data from XML/JSON the Field will not remain hidden. NOTE: The data, dataRef and guideStatePathRef must not be null simultaneously and only one property must be specified. Specifying more than one can lead to undesired results. Parameters: Name Type Description options object object containing the callbacks to be invoked on success/failure and data from where to restore the object. Properties Name Type Argument Description success function &lt;optional&gt; callback which receives the result of the API in case of success errors property as false. error function &lt;optional&gt; callback which receives the result of the API in case of failure. errors property as true. context object &lt;optional&gt; this object inside the success and error callback will point to this object. data object &lt;optional&gt; It must be the value of the data property passed to the success handler of getGuideState API. dataRef string &lt;optional&gt; URL pointing to the data JSON/XML. guideStatePathRef string &lt;optional&gt; URL pointing to the JSON state of Adaptive Form.
