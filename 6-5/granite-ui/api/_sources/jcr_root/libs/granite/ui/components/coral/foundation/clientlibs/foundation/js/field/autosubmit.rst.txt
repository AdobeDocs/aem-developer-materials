***************************

The form has a very nice feature where when everything is configured properly, pressing "enter" in the text field will submit the form.
But unfortunately there is no similar feature for checkbox or other fields.
So this autosubmit is a concept when the input changes, the form will be submitted automatically.

The typical use case would be in search form when changing the field should update the search result (by submitting the form) straight away.
