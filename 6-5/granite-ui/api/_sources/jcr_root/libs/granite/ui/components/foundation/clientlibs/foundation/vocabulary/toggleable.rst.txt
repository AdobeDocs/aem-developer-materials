A good example is a modal dialog, where it can shown to the user and closed accordingly.

Selector Rule::

   .foundation-toggleable


foundation-toggleable-show event
================================

The event that MUST be triggered when the toggleable is shown (from hidden previously).

The event has the following interface:

.. code-block:: ts

   interface FoundationToggleableShowEvent {
     (): void;
   }

Example:

.. code-block:: js

   $(document).on("foundation-toggleable-show", function(e) {});


foundation-toggleable-hide event
================================

The event that MUST be triggered when the toggleable is hidden (from shown previously).

The event has the following interface:

.. code-block:: ts

   interface FoundationToggleableHideEvent {
     (): void;
   }

Example:

.. code-block:: js

   $(document).on("foundation-toggleable-hide", function(e) {});


AdaptTo Interface

type
   ``foundation-toggleable``

condition
   ``.foundation-toggleable``

returned type
   ``FoundationToggleable``

.. code-block:: ts

   interface FoundationToggleable {
     /**
      * Returns <code>true</code> if the toggleable is currently shown to the user; <code>false</code> otherwise.
      */
     isOpen(): boolean;

     /**
      * Shows the toggleable to the user.
      * This method will trigger <code>foundation-toggleable-show</code> event.
      *
      * @param anchor The anchor that can be used as a reference when showing the element.
      *               Note that this param MAY be overloaded in the future (e.g. MouseEvent is passed).
      *               As such the implementor is REQUIRED to cater for the param that it doesn't understand.
      */
     show(anchor?: Element): void;

     /**
      * Hides the toggleable from the user.
      * This method will trigger <code>foundation-toggleable-hide</code> event.
      */
     hide(): void;
   }
