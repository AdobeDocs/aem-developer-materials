	<P>The method</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>void
	Node.removeShare()</FONT></FONT> 
	</P>
	<P>removes the node from
	its shared set without affecting the other nodes in the set. The
	method</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>void
	Node.removeSharedSet()</FONT></FONT></P>
	<P>removes the node and
	all the members of its shared set.</P>
	<P>In the first case,
	assuming more than one member in the shared set, the children of the
	removed node are unaffected since they still have at least one other
	node as parent. In the second case, however, the children of the
	shared set are removed. 
	</P>
	<P>In cases where the
	shared set consists of a single node, or when these methods are
	called on a non-shareable node, their behavior is identical to
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>Node.remove()</FONT></FONT>.
		</P>
	<P>When applied to a
	shared node with at least one other member in its shared set, the
	method</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>void
	Item.remove</FONT></FONT> or</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>void
	Session.removeItem</FONT></FONT></P>
	<P>may behave as
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>Node.removeShare()</FONT></FONT>
	or as <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>Node.removeSharedSet()</FONT></FONT>.
	Which behavior is adopted is an implementation issue. 
	</P>
	<P>The behavior of
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>Node.remove()</FONT></FONT>
	is permitted to vary across repositories because the details of the
	underlying implementation will make one or the other of the
	behaviors more natural for that repository. In particular if a
	repository implements a shared set by one “primary” parent (that
	controls the lifetime of the child) and zero or more “secondary”
	parents (that reference that child), then <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>Item.remove</FONT></FONT>
	is most naturally interpreted differently on the primary parent and
	one of the secondary parents. To force that repository to do a
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>Node.removeShare</FONT></FONT>
	on the primary parent would require that implementation to pick one
	of the secondary parents as the new primary parent, and change all
	of the other secondary parents to refer to that new primary parent.</P>
	<P>For all three methods,
	the removal is dispatched on <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>Session.save()</FONT></FONT>.</P>
