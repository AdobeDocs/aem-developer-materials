	<P>Through a session, the
	user can access, read and write the nodes and properties of the
	bound workspace, to the extent allowed by that user's authorization
	and the capabilities of the repository. Any object acquired,
	directly, or indirectly through a chain of interceding objects, from
	a particular session, is said to be within the scope of that session
	and any method called on such object is also within the scope of the
	same session.</P>
	<P>In the context of
	discussing a particular object or method call, the session within
	whose scope that object or method call lies is referred to as the
	<I>current session</I>, and the workspace to which that session is
	bound is referred to as the <I>current workspace</I>.</P>
