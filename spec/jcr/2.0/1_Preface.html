<P>The Content Repository
API for Java™ Technology Specification, Version 2.0 (JCR 2.0
Specification) consists of a normative part and a non-normative part.</P>
<P>The normative part
consists of:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>This document,
	excluding the appendix.</P>
	<LI><P>The source code of
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>javax.jcr
	</FONT></FONT>and its subpackages.</P>
	<LI><P>The Javadoc
	reference.</P>
</UL>
<P>In case of a conflict
this document takes precedence over the source code and the source
code takes precedence over the Javadoc.</P>
<P>The non-normative part
consists of:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The appendix of
	this document.</P>
	<LI><P>The <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>jar</FONT></FONT>
	file of <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>javax.jcr</FONT></FONT>
	and its subpackages.</P>
</UL>
<P>The JCR 2.0
Specification was created and released through the Java Community
Process (JCP) under Java Specification Request 283 (JSR 283).</P>
<a name="1.1 Previous Versions"></a><H2>1.1 Previous Versions</H2>
<P>The Content Repository
for Java™ Technology API Specification, Version 1.0 (JCR 1.0
Specification) was created and released through the Java Community
Process (JCP) under Java Specification Request 170 (JSR 170).</P>
<a name="1.2 Coverage"></a><H2>1.2 Coverage</H2>
<P>This document describes
the abstract repository model and Java API of JCR. The API is
described from a high-level, functional perspective. Consult the
accompanying Javadoc for full information on signature variants and
exceptions.</P>
<a name="1.2.1 Classes and Interfaces"></a><H3>1.2.1 Classes and Interfaces</H3>
<P>Unless otherwise
indicated, all Java classes and interfaces mentioned are in the
package <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>javax.jcr</FONT></FONT>
and its subpackages. Non-JCR classes mentioned are always fully
qualified. The only exception is <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>java.lang.String</FONT></FONT>,
which is used throughout and written simply as <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>String</FONT></FONT>.</P>
<a name="1.2.2 Null Parameters"></a><H3>1.2.2 Null Parameters</H3>
<P>When describing JCR API
methods, this specification and the Javadoc assume that all
parameters passed are non-<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>null</FONT></FONT>,
unless otherwise stated. If <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>null</FONT></FONT>
is passed as parameter and its behavior is not explicitly described
in this specification or in the Javadoc, then the behavior of the
method in that case is implementation-specific.</P>
<a name="1.3 Typographical Conventions"></a><H2>1.3 Typographical Conventions</H2>
<P>A <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>monospaced
font</FONT></FONT> is used for JCR names and paths, and
all instances of machine-readable text (Java code, XML, grammars,
JCR-SQL2 examples, URIs, etc.).</P>
<a name="1.3.1 String Literals in Syntactic"></a><H3>1.3.1 String Literals in Syntactic
Grammars</H3>
<P>Formal
grammars are used at various places in the specification to define
the syntax of string-based entities such as names, paths, search
languages and other notations.</P>
<P>When
a <I>string literal</I>
appears as a terminal symbol within a grammar, each character literal
in that string corresponds to exactly one Unicode code point.</P>
<P>The
intended code point of such a character literal must be determined
only by reference to the Unicode Basic Latin code chart<SUP><A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A></SUP>
and no other part of the Unicode character set. 
</P>
<P>Any
code point outside the Basic Latin set <I>cannot</I>
be the intended code point of such a character literal, even if the
grapheme of the code point superficially resembles that of the
character literal.</P>
<P>For
example, in the following production (excerpted from §3.2.2 <I>Local
Names</I>).</P>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">InvalidChar
::= '/' | ':' | '[' | ']' | '|' | '*'</FONT></P>
<P>The code points
indicated by the character literals are, respectively, <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>U+002F</FONT></FONT>
(“<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>/</FONT></FONT>”),
<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>U+003A</FONT></FONT>
(“<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>:</FONT></FONT>”),
<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>U+005B</FONT></FONT>
(“<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>[</FONT></FONT>“),
<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>U+005D</FONT></FONT>
(“<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>]</FONT></FONT>”),
<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>U+007C</FONT></FONT>
(“<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>|</FONT></FONT>”)
and <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>U+002A</FONT></FONT>
(“<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>*</FONT></FONT>”).</P>

<P>NOTICE; LIMITED LICENSE
GRANTS</P>
<P>1. License for Purposes
of Evaluation and Developing Applications. Licensor hereby grants you
a fully-paid, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, limited
license (without the right to sublicense), under Licensor's
applicable intellectual property rights to view, download, use and
reproduce the Specification only for the purpose of internal
evaluation. This includes developing applications intended to run on
an implementation of the Specification provided that such
applications do not themselves implement any portion(s) of the
Specification.</P>
<P>2. License for the
Distribution of Compliant Implementations. Licensor also grants you a
perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, fully paid-up,
royalty free, limited license (without the right to sublicense) under
any applicable copyrights or, subject to the provisions of subsection
4 below, patent rights it may have covering the Specification to
create and/or distribute an Independent Implementation of the
Specification that: (a) fully implements the Specification including
all its required interfaces and functionality; (b) does not modify,
subset, superset or otherwise extend the Licensor Name Space, or
include any public or protected packages, classes, Java interfaces,
fields or methods within the Licensor Name Space other than those

other than to the extent of your fair use rights, or distributing the
Specification to third parties).</P>
<P>3. Pass-through
Conditions. You need not include limitations (a)-(c) from the
previous paragraph or any other particular “pass through”
requirements in any license You grant concerning the use of your
Independent Implementation or products derived from it. However,
except with respect to Independent Implementations (and products
derived from them) that satisfy limitations (a)-(c) from the previous
paragraph, You may neither: (a) grant or otherwise pass through to
your licensees any licenses under Licensor's applicable intellectual
property rights; nor (b) authorize your licensees to make any claims
concerning their implementation's compliance with the Specification.</P>
<P>4. Reciprocity
Concerning Patent Licenses. With respect to any patent claims covered

you fail to comply with any material provision of or act outside the
scope of the licenses granted above.</P>
<P>7. Trademarks. No
right, title, or interest in or to any trademarks, service marks, or
trade names of Licensor is granted hereunder. Java is a registered
trademark of Sun Microsystems, Inc. in the United States and other
countries.</P>
<P>8. Disclaimer of
Warranties. The Specification is provided “AS IS”. LICENSOR MAKES
NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT (INCLUDING AS A
CONSEQUENCE OF ANY PRACTICE OR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SPECIFICATION),

such changes in the Specification will be governed by the
then-current license for the applicable version of the Specification.</P>
<P>9. Limitation of
Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION,
LOST REVENUE, PROFITS OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND
REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
ANY FURNISHING, PRACTICING, MODIFYING OR ANY USE OF THE
SPECIFICATION, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES.</P>
<P>10. Report. If you
provide Licensor with any comments or suggestions in connection with
your use of the Specification (“Feedback”), you hereby: (i) agree
that such Feedback is provided on a non-proprietary and
non-confidential basis, and (ii) grant Licensor a perpetual,
