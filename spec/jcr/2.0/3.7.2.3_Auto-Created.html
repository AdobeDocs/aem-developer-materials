	<P>An
	item may be declared <I>auto-created</I>,
	meaning that it is automatically created upon creation of its parent
	node. The auto-created attribute is a boolean.</P>
	<H5>3.7.2.3.1 Auto-Created and Non-Protected</H5>
	<P>If an item is
	auto-created but not protected then it <I>must</I> be <I>immediately</I>
	created in transient space when its parent node is created. Creation
	of auto-created non-protected items must never be delayed until save
	(see §10.11 <I>Saving</I>).</P>
	<H5>3.7.2.3.2 Auto-Created and Protected</H5>
	<P>If an item is both
	auto-created and protected, then it <I>should</I> be immediately
	created in transient space when its parent node is created. Creation
	of auto-created protected items should not be delayed until save,
	though doing so does not violate JCR compliance. In some
	implementations the value of an auto-created property may be
	assigned upon save, in such cases the creation of the property may
	also be delayed until save (see, for example, §3.7.1 <I>Identifier
	Assignment</I>).</P>
	<H5>3.7.2.3.3 Auto-created and Same-Name Siblings</H5>
	<P>In a repository that
	supports same-name siblings (see §22 <I>Same-Name Siblings</I>), a
	child node definition may specify that a node be both auto-created
	and allow same-name siblings. In that case the repository must
	create at least one such child node with the specified name upon
	parent node creation, though it may create more than one.</P>
	<H5>3.7.2.3.4 Auto-created and Residual Definitions</H5>
	<P>In repositories that
	support residual definitions, an item cannot be both auto-created
	and residual (see §3.7.2.1.2 <I>Item Definition Name and Residual
	Definitions</I>).</P>
	<H5>3.7.2.3.5 Chained Auto-creation</H5>
	<P>An auto-created node
	may itself have auto-created child items, resulting in the automatic
	creation of a tree of items. However, chaining that produces an
	infinite loop of item creation is not permitted. A repository must
	ensure that at no time does it have a set of registered node types
	that could result in such behavior (see §19 <I>Node Type
	Management</I>).</P>
