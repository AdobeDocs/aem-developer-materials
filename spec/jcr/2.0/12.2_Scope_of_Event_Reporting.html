	<P>The scope of event
	reporting is implementation-dependent. An implementation should make
	a <I>best-effort</I> attempt to report all events, but may exclude
	events if reporting them would be impractical given implementation
	or resource limitations. For example, on an import, move or remove
	of a subgraph containing a large number of items, an implementation
	may choose to report only events associated with the root node of
	the affected graph and not those for every subitem in the structure.</P>
