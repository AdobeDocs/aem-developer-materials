	<P>An implementation is
	free to limit the scope of journaling both in terms of coverage
	(that is, which parts of a workspace may be observed and which
	events are reported) and in terms of time and storage space. For
	example, a repository can limit the size of a journal log by
	stopping recording after it has reached a certain size, or by
	recording only the tail of the log (deleting the earliest event when
	a new one arrives). Any such mechanisms are assumed to be within the
	scope of implementation configuration.</P>
