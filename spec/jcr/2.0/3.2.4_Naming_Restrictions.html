	<P>This definition of <I>JCR
	name</I> represents the <I>least restrictive</I> set of constraints
	permitted for the naming of items and other entities. A repository
	<I>may</I> further restrict the names of entities to a subset of JCR
	names and in most cases is encouraged to do so. 
	</P>
	<P>In a read-only
	repository, any such restrictions will stem trivially from the fact
	that the repository controls the set of entity names exposed. A
	writable repository <I>may</I> enforce any implementation-specific
	constraint by causing an exception to be thrown on an invalid JCR
	write method call.</P>
	<P>The characters
	declared invalid within a local name (“<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>/</FONT></FONT>”,
	“<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>:</FONT></FONT>”,
	“<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>[</FONT></FONT>“,
	“<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>]</FONT></FONT>”,
	“<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>|</FONT></FONT>”,
	“<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=2>*</FONT></FONT>”)
	represent only those characters which are used as metacharacters in
	JCR names, paths and name-matching patterns (see §5.2.2 <I>Iterating
	Over Child Items</I>). These restrictions are not necessarily
	sufficient to enforce best practices in the creation of JCR names.
	In particular, the minimal grammar defined here permits JCR names
	with leading and trailing whitespace as well as characters which may
	appear superficially identical while representing different code
	points, creating a potential security issue.</P>
	<P>Though this
	specification does not attempt to define good naming practice,
	implementers are discouraged from permitting names with these and
	other problematic characteristics when possible. However, there may
	be cases where the latitude provided by the minimal grammar is
	useful, for example, when a JCR implementation is built on top of an
	existing data store with an unconventional naming scheme.</P>
