								<p class="c5">
									A node type may have one (or in some implementations, more than one) <i>supertype</i>. A subtype inherits the property and child node definitions of its supertype(s) (and possibly other attributes) and may declare further property or child node definitions.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Configuring the inheritance hierarchy of node types available within a particular repository is outside the scope of this specification. For this reason the specification does not define how conflicts between multiple super types are resolved or exactly which attributes of a node type (other than its child node and property definitions) are inherited by its subtypes. For example, the question of whether the orderable child nodes setting of a node type is inherited by its subtypes is left up to the particular implementation. See also, <a href="6.7.22.2_Additions_to_the_Hierarchy.html">6.7.22.2</a> <i>Additions to the Hierarchy</i>.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Some repositories may support multiple inheritance of node types. As a result, the methods for discovering node type information must allow for the possibility that a node type has more than one supertype. See <a href="6.7.11_Discovering_the_Definition_of_a_Node_Type.html">6.7.11</a> <i>Discovering the Definition of a Node Type</i>.
