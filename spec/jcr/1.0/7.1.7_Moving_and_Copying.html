										Moves the node at <b>srcAbsPath</b> (and its entire subtree) to the new location at <b>destAbsPath</b>.

										In order to persist the change, <b>save</b> must be called on either the session or a common ancestor to both the source and destination locations.

										A <b>ConstraintViolationException</b> is thrown either immediately (by this method) or on <b>save</b> if performing this operation would violate a node type or implementation-specific constraint. Implementations may differ on when this validation is performed.

									<p class="c5">
										As well, a <b>ConstraintViolationException</b> will be thrown on <b>save</b> if an attempt is made to save <i>only</i> either the source or destination node separately.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										Note that this behavior differs from that of <b>Workspace.move</b> (see below), which operates directly in the persistent workspace and does not require a <b>save</b>.

It does not specify a position within the child node ordering. If ordering is supported by the node type of the parent node of the new location, then the newly moved node is appended to the end of the child node list.

									<p class="c5">
										This method cannot be used to move just an individual property by itself. It moves an entire node and its subtree (including, of course, any properties contained therein).

									<p class="c5">
										If no node exists at <b>srcAbsPath</b> or no node exists one level above <b>destAbsPath</b> (in other words, there is no node that will serve as the parent of the moved item) then a <b>PathNotFoundException</b> is thrown either immediately or on <b>save</b>. Implementations may differ on when this validation is performed.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										An <b>ItemExistsException</b> is thrown either immediately or on save if a property already exists at <b>destAbsPath</b> or a node already exists there and same-name siblings are not allowed. Implementations may differ on when this validation is performed.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										A <b>VersionException</b> is thrown either immediately or on save if the parent node of <b>destAbsPath</b> or the parent node of <b>srcAbsPath</b> is versionable and checked-in, or is non-versionable and its nearest versionable ancestor is checked-in. Implementations may differ on when this validation is performed.
									</p>
									<p class="c5">
										A <b>LockException</b> is thrown either immediately or on save if a lock prevents the move. Implementations may differ on when this validation is performed.

										A <b>RepositoryException</b> is thrown if another error occurs.
