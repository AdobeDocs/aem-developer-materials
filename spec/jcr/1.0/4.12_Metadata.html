									All content in the repository is ultimately accessed through properties (that is, objects that implement the <b>Property</b> interface). The API does not distinguish between “real” content and meta-content.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Such a separation would only duplicate the entire API, since one would probably want to provide the same functionality for handling both meta-content and primary content. The distinction is in any case only meaningful at the level of the application, not the repository. Any particular application built on top of a compliant repository may, of course, choose which content is to be considered “meta”, and which primary.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									However, the API does provide the concept of the <i>primary child item.</i> Any one of a node’s child items may be specified as its primary child item. This item can be directly accessed (without knowing its name) with the method <b>Node.getPrimaryItem()</b>. The primary item of a particular node (if it has one) is declared in its node type.
