									The full set of version histories in the version storage, though stored in a single location in the repository, must be reflected in each workspace as a subtree below the node <b>/jcr:system/jcr:versionStorage</b>. This subtree must be read-only<i>.</i> That is, applications cannot alter this subtree through standard write methods; though the implementation can, of course, alter it as a side-effect of the application calling version-related methods.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									The read-only status of this subtree should be enforced by the implementation as a matter of access control. As a result, the protected status of parts of this subtree (enforced as a matter of node type constraints) is not relevant since, in effect, the entire subtree is protected.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Though the general repository-wide version history is reflected in each workspace, the access that a particular <b>Session</b> gets to that subtree is governed by that <b>Session</b>'s authorization (which is determined either by the <b>Session</b>'s <b>Credentials</b> or an external authorization mechanism), just as it is for any other part of the workspace.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									All <b>nt:versionHistory</b> nodes are found under <b>/jcr:system/jcr:versionStorage</b>, though there may be a structure of intervening subnodes that sort the version histories by some implementation-specific criteria.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									The node type of the node <b>jcr:versionStorage</b> is left up to the implementation.
