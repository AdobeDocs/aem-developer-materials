								<p class="c5">
									Every <b>Item</b> object (instance of a <b>Node</b> or <b>Property</b>) is associated with the <b>Session</b> object through which it was acquired. When changes are made to an <b>Item</b> object, those changes are recorded in its associated <b>Session</b> and immediately reflected in the <b>Item</b> object itself. In other words, after a change is made, a subsequent re-retrieval of the same item entity <i>through the same</i> <b>Session</b>, will return an <b>Item</b> object reflecting the recent change. In this context “retrieval through the same <b>Session</b>” includes not just acquisition of nodes and properties through the getter methods (like <b>getNode</b>, <b>getProperty</b> etc.) but also items returned through other means, such as within the result set of a query.
