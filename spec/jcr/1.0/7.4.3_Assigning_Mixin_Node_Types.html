		</h4>
		
			
				
					
						
							
								<p class="c5">
									To assign a mixin type, the method<br>
									<b>Node.addMixin(String mixinName)</b> is used. The mixin type adds additional child node or property definitions to a node (i.e., either permitting or requiring additional child nodes or properties).
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Conflicts with other mixin node types or with the primary node type that are detected immediately will cause a <b>ConstraintViolationException</b> to be thrown on the <b>addMixin</b> call. Conflicts detected upon <b>save</b> will cause a <b>ConstraintViolationException</b> to be thrown at that time. Which conflicts are detected at which stage may differ across implementations.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Note that the <i>orderable child nodes status</i> of a mixin node type has no effect, so it will never conflict with the orderable child nodes status of the primary node type.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									In some implementations it may be possible to add mixin types to a node only before the first <b>save</b> of that node (in effect, at node creation). Other implementations may support dynamic addition, and possibly removal, of mixin node types during a node's lifetime. The method <b>Node.removeMixin</b> is provided for those cases that support dynamic removal. If an implementation does not support dynamic addition or removal, the <b>addMixin</b> or <b>removeMixin</b> method will throw a <b>ConstraintViolationException</b>.
