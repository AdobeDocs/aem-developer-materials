								<p class="c5">
									In some cases, a property may have more than one value. A property that may have more than one value is referred to as a multi-valued property (regardless of whether it currently has one or more than one value).
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Whether a particular property is a multi-valued property is governed by the property definition applicable to it, which is determined by the node type of the property's parent node.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									The values within a multi-valued property are ordered.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Accessing the values of such a property is done with the method <b>Property.getValues</b>, which returns an array of <b>Value</b> objects that contains the values in their prescribed order.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Accessing a multi-valued property with <b>Property.getValue</b>, or a single-value property with <b>Property.getValues</b> will throw a <b>ValueFormatException</b>.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									The values stored within a multi-valued property are all of the same type.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									As with single-value properties, there is no such thing as a <b>null</b> value. If a value within a multi-value property is set to <b>null</b>, this is equivalent to removing that value from the value array. In such a case the array is automatically compacted: shifting the indexes of those values with indexes greater than that of the removed value by -1.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Note that this <i>does</i> mean that a multi-value property can have <i>no values</i> (i.e., be an empty array), whereas a single-value property either has a (non-null) value or does not exist.
								</p>
