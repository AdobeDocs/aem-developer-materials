									If the parent node supports orderable child nodes <i>and</i> same-name siblings then the same-name sibling child nodes will be orderable by the application just like an other child nodes. For example, given the following initial ordering of child nodes,
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									<b>[A, B, C, A, D]</b>
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									a call to
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									<b>orderBefore("A[2]","A[1]")</b>
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									will cause the child node currently called <b>A[2]</b> to be moved to the position before the child node currently called <b>A[1]</b>, the resulting order will be:
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									<b>[A, A, B, C, D]</b>
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c14">
									where the first <b>A</b> is the one that was formerly after <b>C</b> and the second <b>A</b> is the one that was formerly at the head of the list.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									Note, however, that after the completion of this operation <i>the indices of the two nodes have now switched</i>, due to their new positions relative to each other. What was formerly <b>A[2]</b> is now <b>A[1]</b> and what was formerly <b>A[1]</b> is now <b>A[2]</b>.
								</p>
