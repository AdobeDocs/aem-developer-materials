									A <b>REFERENCE</b> property stores the UUID of a referenceable node (one having type <b>mix:referenceable</b>). The referential integrity of <b>REFERENCE</b> properties must be guaranteed.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									In level 2 implementations, enforcement of referential integrity means that when a node is <b>remove</b>d, a check must be done to ensure that no <b>REFERENCE</b> properties in the workspace still refer to nodes in the subtree to be removed. This check is done when an attempt is made to persist the removal of a node (that is, either on <b>save</b>, or, if the change was made within a transaction, on <i>commit</i>; in any case, the check is not done immediately on <b>remove</b>). If any references to a node in the subtree to be removed exist, a <b>ReferentialIntegrityException</b> is thrown.
								</p>
							
							
								<p class="c5">
									An exception is made to the referential integrity rule when the <b>REFERENCE</b> property in question is part of the frozen state of a version stored in version storage. In that case the frozen <b>REFERENCE</b> property may hold the UUID of a node that is no longer in the workspace (see <a href="8.2.2.9_Reference_Properties_within_a_Version.html">8.2.2.9</a> <i>Reference Properties within a Version</i>).
